Let me just run down there in my underwear and see what's going on in the dark\", and you're like \"what is your problem? Call the police\", and she's like \"okay\" but it's too late because she's already getting murdered. Well, er, my story's kind of like that.\n\nFLASHBACK - \"Two Weeks Ago\" - Jess is in a taxi, on the phone to Cece, her best friend.\nJESS: It's a surprise for Spencer. I'm just gonna walk in and I'm gonna drop my coat on the ground. He says he had this fantasy that I'm a stripper with a heart of gold, and he's helping me put myself through college.\nCECE: He didn't say the college part, did he?\nJESS: Um, no, I wanted to create a three-dimensional sex character.\nCECE: Really? What's your stripper name?\nJESS: Uh... Rebecca Johnson?\nCECE: Your stripper name's Rebecca Johnson?\nJESS: Boobies Johnson. Two-boobs Johnson.\nCECE: Look at you, in the back of a cab, totally naked. I am so proud of you.\n\nSCENE: Spencer's House - Jess enters through the front door, wearing nothing but a coat.\nJESS: Hellooo? I came home early.\nSPENCER: (Steps out of a room, surprised, wearing nothing but his underwear.) Jess. What-\nJESS: Who's Jess? You're talking to...Tiger Boobs. (Jess takes off her coat and drops it on the ground, now completely naked.)\nSPENCER: Oh...\nJESS: (Jess picks up a pillow, covers herself and starts dancing seductively a bit and sings a little stripper tune.) (Singing) I'm doing sexy things (starts trotting to the side) with the pillow.\nSPENCER: This-\nJESS: (While shaking a plant, singing) I''m doing sexy stuff to the plant right here... (The plant falls over, making a mess.)\nSPENCER: Woah, okay.\nJESS: (Singing) I'll pick that up later.\nJESS: (Turns around, singing) Who's that girl? (Louder) Who's that girl? (Spins back around) It's Jess!\n(Another girl stands by Spencer in her underwear)\nSPENCER: Um...\n(Jess stands and stares in absolute shock.)\nClose up of a ribbon dropping to the floor that was previously covering Jess' lady parts.\nFlashback End.\n\nSCENE: Back in the apartment.\nJESS: So, that happened. That's why I need a new apartment. I'm sorry, what was the question again?\n(We now see Nick, Schmidt and Coach sat opposite Jess on the other sofa. They're all staring at her, speechless.)\nNICK: Do you have any pets?\n\nOPENING CREDITS\n\nSCENE: Everyone remains where they were before the opening credit.\nJESS: You know what's funny? When I saw your ad on Craigslist, I thought you were women.\nSCHMIDT: (Nick, Schmidt and Coach laugh and joke a bit, Schmidt suddenly turns serious) Why would you think that? That's crazy. I mean, what-\nNICK: Schmidt wrote the ad.\nJESS: Oh. I guess it was something about the words you used. It was like, er, like \"sun-soaked\" and \"beigey\".\nNICK: (Nick and Coach laugh more, Schmidt takes off his top) What are you doing?\nCOACH: Wow.\nSCHMIDT: What about these? These look beigey to you?\nNICK: I'm sorry.\nCOACH: I'm his trainer so, er, it's kind of the house that coach built right here. (Coach slaps Schmidt's abs and rubs them a bit)\nNICK: What are we looking at here? That's baby smooth.\nSCHMIDT: This is LLS. Ladies Love Schmidt.\nCOACH: What!? What did you just say? Go put a dollar in the jar right now. (There is a jar sat on a table with the label \"DOUCHEBAG JAR\")\nSCHMIDT: Are you serious?\nCOACH: Yeah! Now.\nSCHMIDT: Dammit. (He gets up and walks out of shot, putting a dollar in the douchebag jar on his way)\nNICK: LLS, what is wrong with you?\nJESS: (Now standing) This place is beautiful. It gets so much light. Spencer hated light. It's hard to say his name.\nSCHMIDT: It's okay. Nick knows. He got dumped.\nNICK: (Sniggering) Dumped. Yeah, I got dumped.\n\n   FLASHBACK - A restaurant, Nick and his ex-girlfriend, Caroline are sat at a table.\nNICK: (With hands over his hears, shouting over Caroline) I can't hear you, that means we're not breaking up! We can't break up if I can't hear you! No! La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!\nCAROLINE: (While Nick is shouting) I need a break. Yes, we're breaking up. I'm breaking up with you. I need some time away-\n\n END FLASHBACK - Back in the apartment\nNICK: Yeah, I got dumped. She dumped. And I'm over it. Okay, it was six months ago, guys. Get past it. I don't even know why we're still talking about it. Why's everybody looking at me? (He puts his head in his hands. Suddenly Nick, Schmidt and Coach approach Jess, who is in the kitchen now, they stand on the opposite side of a counter)\nJESS: You know what, I want to live here.\nNICK: Actually, I still have some questions. I mean, like, no offence but we barely know ya.\nJESS: Yeah, okay, yeah. So, um, full disclosure, I'm kind of emotional right now 'cause of the break-up so I'll probably be watching Dirty Dancing at least 6 or 7 times... a day.\n(Coach shakes his head slightly, looks and is disgusted)\nJESS: Um, I'm a teacher so I bring home a lot of popsicle sticks, stuff like that. Also, I like to sing to myself - a lot. (Singing) A lot... I'm tired of living with my friend. She's a model. All her friends are models.\nSCHMIDT: (Excited) Er, how soon can you move in?\nNICK: Actually, Schmidt, slow down.\nCOACH: Not happening.\nSCHMIDT: Okay, um, can you give us a second? I've just gotta.. (Thumping his chest) I gotta talk to my boys.\nNICK: \"My boys\" is not a thing in here.\nSCHMIDT: My bros.\nNICK: Okay, Douchebag Jar.\nSCHMIDT: Come on, you're my bros.\n\nTIME JUMP - The apartment - Nick, Schmidt and Coach are in the bathroom talking.\nSCHMIDT: I'm gonna say yes. Her friends are models. Okay, you guys? Models.\nCOACH: I say no. I need to be able to come home from work, sit on my couch, and let my beans out. Let 'em breathe.\nSCHMIDT: Nick, it's all you, buddy.\nNICK: Well, first, let me say I think you guys make some really interesting points. Points that I respect, but I will say this. I have lived with a woman, Caroline, as you guys know, and so I know that there are pros and I know that there are real cons, guys.\nCOACH: Nick, you're weak!\nNICK: Okay, Pros: they smell nice. Cons: every once in a while, the mood changes and you're not sure why. They'll ruin your life if you let 'em, they'll break down your will to live. Pros: they're really good at folding.\nCOACH: Make a decision!\nNICK: I'm sorry, you know what? But, like, another pro, like when you-\nSCHMIDT: Don't do it, put it down.\nCoach: Don't.\nNICK: I got it. (Puts a hood on and slowly pulls it over his face)\nSCHMIDT: Don't hood me. Please don't hood me. Okay.\nNICK: I know what I'm talking about.\nCOACH: We pushed him too hard.\nSCHMIDT: We did push him too hard. How about this? Executive decision, she's in.\nJESS: (Out of shot) Yay, I'm in! (Schmidt walks over and opens the bathroom door. Jess is stood there.)\nJESS: You are not gonna regret this.\n\nTIME JUMP - The apartment - Jess sits alone on the floor watching Dirty Dancing, crying her eyes out, she is surrounded by used tissues and wrappers. Nick, Schmidt and Coach stare from a difference.\nNICK: What have you done, Schmidt?  (Coach stares at Schmidt, who shrugs like whaaat?)\n\nSCENE: The apartment - Jess lies on a sofa watching Dirty Dancing, it's still quite messy around her, she's on the phone to her mother.\nJESS: I gotta go, mom. No, I'm not watching Dirty Dancing. (Nick enters.)\nJESS: No, I don't think so. (To Nick) Hey, are you gonna murder me 'cause you're a stranger I met on the internet?\nNICK: Yes, I am.\nJESS: He says no.  \n(Schmidt and Coach enter, they've been working out.)\nJESS: No, look, I gotta go, okay? Alright, love you. Bye.\nSCHMIDT: So the Wild West party's on Saturday. I'm trying to get us in but you may need to call Caroline.\nNICK: (Quickly) I'm not calling Caroline.\nSCHMIDT: Hear me out.\n(Nick shushes Schmidt and puts his hand on Schmidt's mouth.)\nJESS: (Singing along with Dirty Dancing) ... had the time of my life.\nNICK: (Pointing at Jess) We are in this situation because of you.\nJESS: (Jess begins punching the sofa/pillows in the background) I hate your face, Spencer, I love you!\nNICK: It has been a week of this madness. I am going crazy, Schmidt, I can't take it.\nCOACH: You know what? I got this. (He walks over to Jess and sits on the coffee table opposite her)\nJESS: Hi, Coach.\nCOACH: (Firmly) Stop it. Stop!\n(Jess starts wailing even louder than before)\nCOACH: Schmidt!\nSCHMIDT: Okay. Alright. I got us into this, I'm gonna get us out. Jess, I'm gonna take the remote. (TV turning off sound) Alright. Alright, hey, Jess. (Jess just points at the TV) How you doing? (Jess shrugs like 'put the tv back on')  You look fantastic. Listen, what if you came out with us tonight? You know after work. You know, we'll fix you up, we'll take you out. We'll get you a rebound.\nJESS: A rebound?\nSCHMIDT: Yeah.\nJESS: I don't know if I'm ready.\nSCHMIDT: You're totally ready for it, I'll take you through the whole thing. You know, I'll be like your guide!\nJESS: Like Gandalf through Middle-earth?\nSCHMIDT: Probably not like...okay, first of all, let's take the Lord of the Rings references, let's put 'em in a deep, dark cave, okay, where no one's gonna find them, ever.\nJESS: Except Smeagol, (whispering) he lives in a cave.\nSCHMIDT: You know what, Jess? Come on. Let's just take the head off the couch. Come on. Sit up, girl. (Jess sits up straight) Look at that, doesn't that feel good? There we go.\nJESS: I think that sounds nice. (Singing) She's going out to find a rebound. Who's that girl? It's Jess!\nNICK: Wait, did you just make up a theme song for yourself?\nSCHMIDT: (After some hesitation) I'm a...I'm a fix it.\n\nSCENE: Schmidt dressed in a suit is chasing Nick down the corridor of the apartment.\nNICK: I'm not calling my ex-girlfriend to get you into a party. (Nick is walking down the corridor with a towel over his shoulder Schmidt following behind.)\nSCHMIDT: This party is everything to me, please Nick. We go every year, you have no idea what I'm going through at work. \n\n FLASHBACK - Schmidt in a meeting room, addressing a table of women.\nSCHMIDT: (Shouting over the noise of protesting women) I am just trying to do my work. I'm just trying to do a good job, here. \nWOMAN: Nice tie, can I borrow a tampon? (Teasingly, laughter in the background.)\n\nFLASHBACK END - Schmidt shudders at the memory. Nick and Schmidt are in the bathroom, whilst Jess is in the shower. \nNICK: Schmidt, I'm not calling her. \nSCHMIDT: Listen to me, knowing every year that I will be going to the Waa Waa West Charity Auction for poverty reminds me that I'm still a man, and I can still motorboat a hot girl who is also a member of the Chiriqu\u00ed nation, which is not racist because it is for a good cause. \nJESS: (From inside the shower) Somebody's in here. \nSCHMIDT: We're leaving in ten minutes, did you shave your legs? \nJESS: I will now. \nSCHMIDT: Front and backs? \nJESS: Yes. \nSCHMIDT: Thank you.\nNICK: (Quietly) Ok, I'm gonna kill myself now. \nSCHMIDT: Just call Caroline, you call her all the time when you're drunk. \nNICK: (Feigning innocence) I don't know to what you are referring. \n\nFLASHBACK - A drunk Nick is on the sofa with a beer on the phone, leaving a drunken voicemail on her            phone \nNICK: (In a very bad British accent, swigging beer) Hello, Caroline. I still love you, so much. (Starts to sob) So, much. (Puts his head in his hands.) \n\nFLASHBACK END - In the bathroom \nNICK: I'm not calling her. \nJESS: (Pulls back shower curtain and gets out, wearing a bright pink swimsuit) Schmidt, I know you really want to go to this party, but wouldn't it be better to find a girl who you really care about to motorboat, then maybe if you're super lucky, you find a girl who'll motorboat you right back. \nNICK: (Smirking) I don't think she knows what motorboating is.\n\n SCENE: Jess's bedroom - with the door open. Jess is wearing a blue robe, whilst staring at her clothe-              scattered bed, deciding what to wear.\nSCHMIDT: (From another room) Jess, we are leaving in five.\nCOACH: (Walks in to the room with a basketball) Hey.\nJESS: (Holding a curling iron in her hair, turns around) Hey Coach, wha-- \nCOACH: (Smashes an ornament with his basketball) Sorry. Uh, my boss says that I don't know how to talk to women, which is ridiculous... \n\nFLASHBACK - Coach in a gym, with a women who is on an exercise bike, she is upset because he is                shouting at her. \nCOACH: SPIN WOMAN, SPIN! AHHHHHHH!\nWOMAN: I'm spinning! You are so mean! (Sobbing)\nCOACH: I'M NOT MEAN, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU! I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU!\n\nFLASHBACK END - Back in Jess's room\nCOACH: So I was wondering if you could, uh, help me out with that.\nJESS: Sure, sure. Absolutely. (Sits down on the edge of her bed) Um, well, first of all, maybe think about what women like to talk about, you know, like, use me for practice.\nCOACH: Alright, uh, um, (clears throat) shopping, is that fun for you guys?\nJESS: Yeah, shopping's fun. Uh, the other day I bought a pair of jeggings, they look like jeans but they're really leggings.\nCOACH: Uh, uh, you-, I-. Who cares!? Sorry.\nJESS: (Nods) Uhm, good job. Uh, a couple of things you could work on, uh 1. Lowering your voice.\nCOACH: Right on.\nJESS: Uhm, 2. Listening. (Her hair begins to smoke) 3. Rage. (Smokes a bit more.)\nCOACH: Absolutely.\nJESS: Uhm, 4.--\nCOACH: Your hair is on fire. (She frowns at him and then glances to the side.)\n\n      SCENE: In the bar, where Nick works as a bartender. He is serving the gang drink whilst they are at a                           table. \nNICK: Beers, and a rose.\nJESS: Pink wines makes me, slutty. (A 'cute' guy walks by)\nJESS: Woah, cute guy alert. (does silly stuff with her glasses whilst making noises whilst Schmidt shakes his head and Coach and Nick glance at each other)\nSCHMIDT: Okay, Jess, gametime. Let's do this. If you wanna forget about Spencer (she nods) you're gonna have to do some very very bad things, (points) with that man, right over there.\nJESS: (glances to look at the man) How bad?\nSCHMIDT: Real bad, Jess. Real bad.\nJESS: Like a, make-out sess, no tops?\nSCHMIDT: (Losing the will) Okay, this is what- this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna go over there and you're gonna stand next to him and you're gonna smile. (she smiles a little creepily) But, you're not gonna smile like that. (Pulls a weird kind of rabbit/chipmunk smile) That looks like a, hungry badger. Pulls the same face but tries to smile as well)\nCOACH: Stop that.\nJESS: Okay, I got this, I got this.\nSCHMIDT: You got this. You got it. Just go make it out.\nCOACH: Get 'em up! Ride 'em out! Go do it. Ride 'em out! Huhah! (they both stand watching as she walks up to the man)\nJESS: (Walks up to the side of him, pulls a pose with her hands on her hips and leans over) Hey, sailor. (He glances at her, and then looks back away)\nCOACH: Oh. Alright.\nSCHMIDT: Alright.\nCOACH: That's okay. Maybe he didn't hear that.\nSCHMIDT: You can come back from that.\nCOACH: Maybe he didn't hear that.\nSCHMIDT: It's all good.\nBENJAMIN: (Noticing it was Schmidt) HOLY SCHMIDT, IT'S SCHMIDT! (Walks towards Schmidt)\nSCHMIDT: Oh, it is all about the Benjamin! Wassup?! (Share a man hug) Alright, P-Funk, what's up dude? This is Coach.\nBENJAMIN: What's up Coach? (Falters when Coach doesn't reply) You like parties?\nCOACH: Don't talk to me. (Walks away)\nBENJAMIN: Yeah, okay.\nSCHMIDT: You know who likes to party hard, right?\nBENJAMIN: Yeah, so you coming on Saturday, I here there's gonna be some fine ladies there?\nSCHMIDT: Uh, maybe, yeah.

Keep your head up, alright?\nSCHMIDT: Alright, player. Do your thing man, it was good seeing you. Alright, man, P-Funk, always. (Walks over to the bar where, Coach, Nick and Jess are) Nick, please.\nNICK: (Leaning over the bar) Why are you friends with those guys?\nSCHMIDT: Nick, please get me in the party, I'm begging you, please.\nNICK: No, I'm not calling Caroline.\nSCHMIDT: Do you know what a cute cowboy I am? Do you have any idea? (Coach gets up and leaves)\n\nSCENE: At the bar, Jess is sitting, eating a meal with a glass of wine, talking to Nick who is working at the         bar.\nJESS: Well, I guess I can't hide my crazy. \nNICK: I don't think you're trying that hard.\nJESS: Well, I've never been, great at this stuff, so... (bites on a celery stick)\n\nFLASHBACK - At someone's home, young Jess is sitting on a chair playing her guitar and singing to a small      group of people at a party.\nJESS: (Singing) What if God was one of us?\nBOY: God, make it stop! (Puts his hands over his ears)\nJESS: (Singing) Just a slob like one of us?\n\nEND OF FLASHBACK - At the bar, with Nick and Jess\nJESS: Looks at us, couple of losers, we both got dumped, jeesh.\nNICK: (Shaking his head) I'm fine. Six months ago so...\nJESS: Do you know why she dumped you? I mean she must've hurt you pretty bad..\nNICK: No, no, it made no difference to me, I just wanted to set her trash cans on fire.\nJESS: So are you always just like wondering, like, what was it, was there something I could've done differently? (he shakes his head) Do you know what happens to people who keep it all inside? They get old, and they get sad and they get weird and then you're the old man yelling at the kids who are running across your yard and you're telling them 'Don't run across my yard, my life's full of regret'. You know, you can't just pretend like it didn't happen.\nNICK: Or I could pretend to be more like you, Jess, and live on a sparkly rainbow and drive a unicorn around and just sing all the time.\nJESS: Yeah, I think you should sing all the time.\nNICK: No, I was being mean, I'm not gonna do that, Jess.\nJESS: Why not?! It's fun!\nNICK: Because I have a penis, Jess.\nJESS: (Singing in an old man's voice) My name is Nick, I have a penis and I'm not gonna let any feelings out.\nNICK: (Leaning forward) Okay Jess, your left boob is resting on a plate of chicken wings.\nJESS: Yeah, I know.\nPETER: (P-FUNK) Hey, I'm Peter. What are you drinking?\nJESS: Oh, I'll have another pink wine. (Nick begins to walk away, taking out his phone)\nPETER: I like your glasses,\nJESS: They help me see.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE: At a table, Jess and Peter are chatting and laughing, being observed by Schmidt and Coach.\nCOACH: She's doing alright.\nBENJAMIN: (Walking up to Schmidt and Coach) Schmidt stain! Hey man. I was thinking that it's probably best that you don't come to the party, that means more breast for me. (Laughs)\nSCHMIDT: (Standing up) You better step down son, you're taking this whole thing too far. Hold me back Coach, I'm seri-. Hold me back. Hold me back! Coach, would you please hold me back.\nNICK: (Walking up to him from the other side of the bar) Schmidt, we're going to the party, relax. \nBENJAMIN: Nice, see you there Schmidtty!

(Walks away)\nJESS: Yeah, cool. I'll call--, cool.\nNICK: So what's happening tomorrow, sailor?\nJESS: You know what, you guys were totally right. I talked in short sentences, I didn't sing, I laughed, I smiled, I said I needed rebound sex and it totally worked. He asked me out. Dinner, with food. Oooh oooh.\nSCHMIDT: I'm so proud of you. (Hugs her)\nCOACH: You got it girl.\nSCHMIDT: You did good.\nCOACH: You got it down. (High fives her)\nJESS: (With her hands in the air) It's Jess, she's on (sings) fiiiirrreee! (Backs away at the same time, starts dancing and all the guys groan because as she turns, they notice her top is tucked in her panties)\nCOACH: Big ass panties.\nNICK: Alright, shall we tell her?\nSCHMIDT: I'll think we'll let her have her moment.\n\n SCENE: At the apartment, Cece is sitting on the couch in a low cut dress, with all the guys staring at her,           whilst she waits for Jess.\nCECE: Do the shoes fit , Jess?\nJESS: (Hears a thump) I'm okay!\nCOACH: What are you, a model or something?\nCECE: Yeah. Yes. Mostly print right now... so.\nSCHMIDT: What is it? Cece? Cecelia? Chechelia? Tell me what are your hopes and dreams? Are you warm? I'm a little, huh, I'm a little warm right now. (Begins to take off his t-shirt)\nNICK: Don't, Schmidt.\nCOACH: All right.\nSCHMIDT: (Finishes taking off his shirt) Oh yeah. There it is. (Breathes deeply an flexes)\nCECE: (Unfazed) Please put your shirt back on. Please don't make me laugh at you.\nSCHMIDT: Can I hit you up with some tea? A little herb tea? Ahhh. Oh my God. How good is that, for real, whaat? A little Peaman tea? Yum, right? Hot, sweet, a little teabag action. And I wasn't, I wasn't talking about...\nNICK: (Reaching over to grab the douchebag jar) There it is. Douchebag.\nCECE: Listen to me you guys, Jess is by far the best person that I know, so if you guys let anything happen to her, I'm gonna come here, and crazy murder you.\nSCHMIDT: I'm gonna be honest with you. I did not hear a word you just said 'cause I can kinda see your party hats right now.\nNICK: (Reaching over for the jar again) Here we go.\nCECE: Jess! (Gets up and walks off)\nNICK: (Schmidt deposits another dollar into the douchebag jar) Why are you talking like this?\n\n  SCENE: Opening Jess' door, Cece sees Jess, sprawled on the floor.\nJESS: I fell off my heels.\nCECE: Okay. Alright. No. Come on. (Kneels to pull Jess up) Get up.\nJESS: Oh, what am I doing? I can't go on a date, what if it's horrible, what if I have nothing to talk about?\nCECE: Then you go to the bathroom and you call me and you tell me all about it.\nJESS: Maybe I just shouldn't go.\nCECE: Babe, you got hurt, that doesn't mean you stop trying. Okay?\nJESS: (Mumbles something and nods)\nCECE: Okay. Let's go, come on. (Both stand up and look at what she's wearing) You gotta take off those overalls.\nJESS: I was going for, like a, like a hot farmer's daughter kinda thing, you know like.

Honestly I, I didn't even realize that you cared about me until we broke up.\nNICK: Okay. Let's get that drink.\nBENJAMIN: (In a western accent) Get along little doggy. Well howdy there, muchachos.\nNICK: (Walking over notices Peter) Hey, where's Jess?\nPETER: Oh, dude, she texted me like seven times. Like long ones. I just wanna hook up.\nNICK: So's she waiting for you to show up, or did you call her?\nPETER: Yeah, that's what I did, I called her.

(Stops in Jess' room and start putting stuff down)\nSCHMIDT: So you recognize? Represent, what.\nWINSTON: Okay, look, I'm gonna be completely honest, I've been messing with you, but it's just that I wanted my old room back. You know, you're right, I've been away a long time and things have changed around here so I kind of got to get used to that. Keep the big room.\nSCHMIDT: So now you're just deep dogging me, man. I'm not scared of your mind games, I'm taking the small room, Winston.\nWINSTON: Schmidt, that's not what I mean...\nSCHMIDT: No no no no no. Why don't you listen to me.

Not tonight.\nJess: What's so bad about liking Gretchen, I mean you guys obviously have like a weird connection?\nSchmidt: No, no, no. I wanna connect with Brooke.

[They look over at Nick and Caroline talking]\nSchmidt: Jess, what did you do? \nJess: Look, they're fine. They're just talking.\nSchmidt: No, not fine.\nWinston: No, no, no. With Caroline, he is not fine. Okay, he ran into her at a party two months ago, then sent me a ten page email about what she meant when she said 'I'll see you soon'.\nSchmidt: She will flirt with until she knows she can have him. It's like he's her back up plan.\nJess: I didn't know that.\nSchmidt: You wanna live with Nick when he's not showering and crying all day?\nWinston: Yeah, it sounds like this.

Nick, Nick! [Jimmy comes up and starts dancing with Jess] Oh, hi. I don't feel like dancing right now, I'm sorry. I'm really uncomfortable right now.Oh Winston, thank God.

Schmidt! I need you to help me take these off so I can go find Nick!\nBrooke: God, are you friends with that girl?\nJess: Schmidt?!!\nSchmidt: Look, I didn't want to have to tell you this but, she was a mistake I made when I hit rock bottom. I was her Sid and she was my Nancy and then I got sober and she couldn't deal with it and the poor thing just went, she went crazy.\nJess: Schmidt! I need you to help me slap my thighs around!\nSchmidt: I don't want to scare you, but she can be very dangerous when she drinks. Okay, I shouldn't even be in the same room as her, it's just, it feels so good talking to you. \nBrooke: Maybe we should get you out of here.\nSchmidt: What a great idea, ues.\nBrooke: I just have to go to the bathroom really quickly.\nSchmidt: Whatever you need, whatever, yeah, of course.\n\n\n\n\n[Scene: Nick and Caroline are in a photo booth]\nNick: Ready, no lips.

Schmidt is very fond of you.\nBrooke: Um, look, I..I don't know...I don't even know him that well, okay? \nJess: Oh! I'm just cutting off my underwear, you know, girl stuff. [Rips them off] Ahh. So tight. Well, it's been really nice chatting with you but I've gotta pretend boyfriend to hunt down, I think he's cheating on me [Brandishing a pallette knife] and don't break Schmidt's heart, or you'll have me to deal with. [Laughs]\n\n[Scene: Nick and Caroline still in the photo booth]\nJess: [Pulls back curtain of photo booth] Aha! I trusted you!\nNick: Jess, get outta here.\nCaroline: Nothing happened.\nJess: After everything we've built. \nNick: Go away, Jess, please.\nJess: Who are you?\nCaroline: No, really, nothing happened. I have a boyfriend.\nNick: Wait, you have a boyfriend?\nCaroline: Yeah, well I've been seeing someone. I didn't want to bring him because I didn't want to hurt your feelings, but now I know that you have Jess...\nJess: Yeah, he has me... and our baby! \nCaroline: Okay, I'm just gonna let  you guys...\nJess: And our other baby!\nSchmidt: [Goes up to Jess] Jess, what happened with Brooke?\nJess: What?\nSchmidt: She just left here in tears because she said that you threatened her with a knife!?\nJess: No, I was talking you up.\nSchmidt: No, you shouldn't have been talking me up, you should've been taking care of Nick. Why is it so hard to do one thing?\nJess: How is this my fault?\nSchmidt: Ruiner.\nJess: Uh, did you just call me a ruiner?\nSchmidt: Yeah.\nJess: Okay, you know what, forget it. I'm not helping you guys anymore. Give me my teeth back. [Goes in Nick's jacket]\nNick: Stop it, Jess.\nJess: You don't appreciate them.\nNick: Cool it!\nJess: Give them back. I'm gonna have fun, [puts in teeth] cause there's nothing wrong with who I am, and I like having fun at weddings, and I like dancing, and if you don't like that, then tough teeter tots, tooter. Jess is back. [Storms off]\nGretchen: [Walks over to Schmidt] Ah, you going home with me aren't you? [Puts the clip on earrings on him] Good boy. [Slaps his ass]\n\n[Scene: Drunken Nick being filmed for the happy couple]\nNick: [Holds up pictures from the photo booth] That's Caroline and that's me. Four years we were together so...it doesn't matter to me, it's just what matter is..respect. [Crying] I'm just so alone right now, man and it's a real bad situation...\nCamera Man: Uh, Steve and Bree.\nNick: Steve and Bree, because that's what this is about, I agree with you, you're good at your job, man. [Turning to the cardboard cut out of Steve and Bree] I'm so happy for you, you look great, it feels a little bit like you're rubbing it in my face, you know, happiness, but let's be honest, Bree, this doesn't look great on you. [Gestures to the dress] This. That's not a great look, Bree! Congratulations, Steve, nice fedora and no open bar, Steve, don't you understand that's tacky! You're dad's rich, you're a lawyer, man. [Kicks over cardboard cut out] Yeah! That happened! [Goes over to the photo booth] The photo booth is a liar, fyi. [Opens curtain] Oh, hey ladies, you guys wanna see a grown man cry? No? Then get out! I think I saw a single doctor looking at you. [To one of the women] This is gonna take a while, Orange.\n\n[Scene: Jess. sitting at a table, blowing bubbles]\nJess: Hi there, partner.\nWinston: [Sits down and put his feet up like Jess] Hey, can I tell you something you promise to never tell Schmidt? I love bubbles! [Laughs] I don't know why, I just always have. [Takes the bubbles and blows some, laughs again] You see that, that was like two in one.\nJess: Woah.\nWinston: Are you okay?\nJess: Yeah, I'm fine.\nWinston: Those guys were jerks, but I know that they're glad you're around.\nJess: Really?\nWinston: Yeahh, I'm just gonna come out and say it, especially Nick, but they're all thinking it. Even me. Most of the time.\nJess: [Smiles] It was weird, when I was stuck in a freak sandwich between you and that eight year old. Do you wanna talk about that?\nWinston: [Sniggers] You know, it's just that he got to be a bit annoying, so.. I kinda took my feelings out with dance...? [Jess laughs]\nSchmidt: Okay, er, so, we have a situation.\n\nScene: [Nick drunkenly talking in the photo booth to himself]\nWinston: Hey, Nick.\nNick: It's mine now.\nWinston: How're you doing, buddy?\nNick: They want me to leave the booth...but I'm staying. This is my home now. It's got everything that I need.\nSchmidt: [Showing the pictures to Jess] You can see by looking at these pictures, that he's experiencing a variety of different emotions. This one is... well that's actually his butt. He just keeps saying, Jess.\nNick: Jess! The fact is, is I was a mean person and I'm sorry, okay?\nJess: [Pokes her head into the booth] Hi, Nicholas.\nNick: Hey, Jess. I live in a photo booth, now.\nJess: Oh, is that so?\nNick: Yup. Come on in, come on in. That's the kitchen area.\nJess: Very nice.\nNick: This is the common area.\nJess: Oh, okay.\nNick: Dining room, living room, kind of everything.\nJess: It's very nice. Hey...she had a boyfriend...\nNick: Yeah.\nJess: She shouldn't have been flirting with you all night. You can't be her back up plan. You have to let each other go. So now, you have to make a decision. Am I gonna stay locked in a photo booth for the next hour or am I gonna get out there, take my shoes off and dance my face off. [Laughs] Come on, it's up to you. [Leaves]\nNick: Oh, man, all right. [Pats the wall] I love you photo booth.

[Hugs him]\nNick: Goodbye, good luck and everything.\nCaroline: Good bye.\nNick: Alright, um, I've gotta, excuse me.

Water crackers are for adults... to eat with adult cheese.\nCan I eat a cracker sushi sandwich?\nNo. Jess.\nWINSTON: So what, you guys are gonna sit around all night playing \"Jingle Bells\"?\n\"Jingle Bells\" is a trash song played on a trash instrument, and I'm not really asking permission, I'm giving you a heads-up.\n(laughs):\nWell, that got serious.\nAnyway, you are gonna love these kids.\n(playing very out-of-tune\n\"Camptown Races\")\nThank you, Schmidt.\nWonderful.\n(continue playing badly)\nGreat, guys!\nSo good.\nJust think, you could be in detention right now.\nIs it too late to choose detention?\nWe suck.\nWe don't suck, we just need a little bit of rehearsal.\nHector, okay, good!\nBig finish, and... we're out.\nI'm so proud of you.\nThat's what it feels like to play a song sort of together.\nBring it in.\nIn.\nYes.\nEnsembell!\nEnsembell!\nFive minutes\n(toilet flushing)\nof text time ... you earned it.\nDESIREE (calls):\nOh, dear... Miss Day!\nDesiree?\nMiss Day!\nOh!\nYou got a twisted toilet, Miss Day.\nNick!\nToilet situation! Code one! Water only!\nYou didn't tell her the system?\nOh, I'm sorry, she went rogue.\nYou have to turn on the faucet before you flush the toilet, 'cause...\n(sighs)\nAll right.\nThank you, Nick.\nAll right.\nThere we go, no problem.\nPerfect. You did it.\nThe plastic soda bottle is right where it's supposed to be ...\nBack in the wall hole.\nWhat? It's fixed.\nI've heard that before.\n \nIt's fixed.\n(squeaking)\nIt's fixed.\n(drill whirrs)\nIt's fixed.\nOkay, Nick, repeat after me:\nI am not the Chinese kid from Goonies.\nYou know, I fix things just to the point of working, Schmidt.\nIf you want a fancy-fix, just say so.\nOkay.\nPlease fancy-fix the toilet.\nThat's all you had to say.\n(bells playing lively melody)\nThat actually sounds really good.\n(lively melody continues)\n(lively melody continues)\n(music pauses)\n(chuckles)\nJESS:\nWhoa.\nYou're amazing!\n \n(shudders)\nGoose pimples.\nLook. Each one...\na memory.\nJESS:\nWinston, please help me.\nJust hear me out.\nTwo things women love ...\nAlternative percussion players and role models.\nThe kids would love it and we'd get to spend time together.\nYou got to do it ... it's a Mitzvah, bro.\nAre you sure you've never rung before?\nBelieve it or not, Jess, I have never played handbells before.\nI just pick things up easy, that's all.\nI know handbells aren't the coolest instrument in the world, they might not even be the fifth coolest, but the kids would love it, it would really mean a lot to them, and if they saw how good you are, I think they'd really get into it and maybe try a little bit harder.\nAlso, there's, like, a lot of potentially cool, like, bell shorthand we could use to talk about...\n(whispers):\nNick...\nwhile he's right there we'll be, like...\n\"Nick's such a tinkle!\"\n\"I think he's more like a tonkel.\"\nTinkle and tonkel are potential bell talk we could use.\nI get it.\nJust be cool, please.\nI am cool.\nBefore you make your decision, I'd only need you till the concert on Sunday.\n(bell dings)\nI don't know, I think I could be into this.\nYay!\nAnd with that statement, he never had sex again.\n Winston and me are playing bells every day... \nUntil Sunday. I'm cool.\nNick, look, I don't mean to nag you, but how long is this gonna take?\nFancy-fix, fancy amount of time.\n'Cause I would like to use my own bathroom now.\nSir, bathrooms are for customers only.\nMm.\nHow dare you.\nIf only there were some sort of pipe and...\nand water expert that we could hire to come and fix this problem.\nYeah, I can't afford a plumber.\nA plumber! That's what it's called!\nYou really want to do this?\nYou want to have this fight with me?\nYou want to go down this path, Schmidt?\nI don't know, is this a path that you recently fixed?\nIt's called self-reliance.\n'Cause unlike you, Schmidt, I don't just throw my money at problems.\nAll I'm hearing is that I can't use my bathroom because you're poor.\nLook, it's your lucky day, buddy.\nI'm gonna pay for the plumber.\nNo, Schmidt, I don't want your charity.\nWell, you seem very happy using my emergency tools.\nOh, yeah? Do you even know what this is?\nDoy, it's a scissor.\nYeah, that's exactly right.\nA scissor. Really, Schmidt?\nYeah, a scissors that you just threw in the turdlet.\nSo, tonight at rehearsal, keep an eye out for Hector.\nI'm having trouble getting him to interact.\nHe really wants to play the drums, so I told him bells were the next best thing, which was a lie, so I couldn't keep a straight face while I was saying it.\nHe saw right through me.\n(laughs)\nSo, why do you do this bell thing, Jess?\nI mean, like, how do you win?\n(laughs)\nYou don't win.\nYou win by helping the kids.\nI just want to get them to care and try hard, you know?\nSo you want them to try hard?\nYeah.\nI'll get them to try hard.\nNo, I'm telling you, they're not gonna listen to you.\nOkay.\nOh, what, a plumber?\nYou plan it this way?\nJust to rub my face in it?\nYes, I wanted to rub your face in our working toilet.\nGreat. Well, that working toilet I will never use.\nYou're never gonna go to the bathroom again?\nOh, you're the soda bottle guy.\nYeah.\nThat was actually pretty smart.\nThank you! Thank you.\nAnd I have nothing to say to you.\nOkay.\nQuestion for you, sir. How much did he pay for this?\nAll right, you know what? That's enough.\n$50? $100?\nInappropriate.\nHey, my name's Schmidt. I was born rich.\nI had a $40,000 Bar Mitzvah.\nOkay.\nHow long you do the petty act for, man, huh?\nA week? A month?\nIs this \"my favorite bedspread\"\nall over again?\nThat was a handmade gift my nanny gave me that you spilled a pitcher of Midori Sours on, and now you bring it up like it's nothing?\nI left you a check for $30 on your pillow.\nYour nanny gave you that thing for free, so as far as I'm concerned, you're up 30 bucks.\nMy nanny is dead!\nI'm not looking to make money off of her!\nI will not apologize again for the Midori Sours!\nWho drinks Midori Sours?!\nEveryone drinks Midori Sours!\nNo, they don't!\nIt's a melon liqueur!\nI would never drink one!\nIt's an American classic with Asian influences!\nWinston would never drink one!\nEnjoy the couch. I bought that, too.\nEnjoy the rug, too ... paid for that.\nOrganic woven.\nWhat are you doing?\nWhat are you doing?\nOh, come on, man.\nWell, I stole the cable!\nAnd my Bar Mitzvah was an amazing event!\n(door slams)\n\n\n\nThe theme was sports jams.\n(bells playing\n\"Camptown Races\" badly)\n(virtuosic playing)\n(last note rings)\nOTHERS: Oh! Wow! Oh, my God! That was really good.\nThat was amazing.\nWow!\nThat was off the hammer!\n(chuckles)\nThe hammer in the bell.\n(Jess laughs)\n Tough crowd. \nWINSTON: Here's what I was thinking, okay?\nIf we want to win this concert, we play something cool, like \"Eye of the Tiger.\"\nGIRL:\nWhat's \"Eye of the Tiger\"?\n\"Eye of the Tiger\" is the greatest song ever written.\nIt's so cool, it ended the Cold War.\nThat's not even a little bit true.\nI never thought bells could be cool.\nWhat do you mean?\nI make bells cool.\nDo that thing where you hold three bells in one hand...\nThree-in-hand.\nI think she's talking about the Winston.\nOTHERS: Yeah. The Winston.\nIt's actually called the three-in-hand.\nI can do it.\nYeah, but can you do this?\n(Winston playing beautiful chords)\n(music stops)\nOh, my God!\nThat was really pretty.\n(exotic accent):\nBut Miss Day has a few tricks up her sleeves as well.\nLet's see what you got.\nYeah, come on, Miss Day.\nLet's see what you got, Miss Day.\n(playing dissonant chords)\n \n(deep, monotone voice):\n I am a robot \n Trying to play the bells \n Don't judge me,\n'cause I can't \n Think at all, I just \n Like to play the bells. \nI want to play\n\"Eye of the Tiger.\"\nYeah, come on, \"Tiger\"!\nYeah, please!\nI don't know, I don't know.\nThat sounds so fun, but we can't, because we don't have time.\nOh, darn!\nHere's what I was thinking.\nIf you skip school and practice, then, boom, you got it.\nMr. Bishop.\nYeah, yeah.\nDone.\n(kids chattering)\nWhat's the deal with Winston?\nHe's really intense.\nOh, look, I grew up with Winston.\nI know how he is.\nHe's incredibly talented, but he's a jerk about it.\nYeah, he's one of those guys that he'll never pass the ball if he thinks he can score.\nJESS: I just don't know why it needs to be a competition.\nThat's just the way some guys are, Jess, you know?\nThey get themselves wrapped up in these insecure, silly games.\nHey, Nick, uh, we're good with that whole plumber thing, right?\nAbsolutely.\nYeah, okay, cool, 'cause...\n'cause I was right about that whole thing.\nOh!\nYeah, I unfixed that.\nWell, how you gonna unfix a dead Schmidt?!\nI'm not worried about it!\n(men shouting)\nYou're so predictable, Schmidt!\n Stop yelling \n I don't want to hear you yelling anymore. \n(sighs)\nWhat...?\nI paid for the freezer, so, you know.\nI'm gonna kill you.\n(humming \"Eye of the Tiger\")\nThat's a, that's a B right there.\nGet that in there.\n(humming \"Eye of the Tiger\")\nYou're fired.\nFocus.\nAre you focused?\nOkay, what's the song about?\nHector?\nHanging tough.

No, no, no, no!\nAre you kidding me?\nIt is not that hard, people.\nIt is an instrument that a cat wears around its neck.\nOkay, you know what, I think they did a pretty great job, considering the fact that they've only played it, like, eight times.\nWell you're wrong, okay You thought wrong, Jess.\nYou know why? Because I'm out here right now by myself in the cold.\nI got no support.\nMaybe we're just not good enough.\nNo, you are good enough.\nThis is not your problem, this is Mr. Bishop's problem.\n Pah  Rest.\n Pah-pah-pah \nRest.\n Pah-pah-pah \nRest.\n Pah-pah-pah... \n(laughs)\nRest.

Hector!\n(screaming wildly)\nI'm sorry, Jess, but I really don't care.\nYou know what, I love running this group.\nIt gives me confidence, it gives me muscle definition.\nYes, sometimes it gives me blinding optical migraines where I literally can't see three feet in front of myself.\nBut I love these kids.\nAnd I'm sorry I kicked you out of group, but one thing you can't do with these kids is make it about you.\nJess, I don't see what the big deal is, okay?\nI only practiced with you guys a couple of times.\nYou're such a tonkel!\nWhoa, hold it!\nDon't nobody call me a tonkel.\nIf you tell them they aren't good, that's one more person telling them that.\nThat's a big deal to me, making sure no one else gives up on them.\nEven if they sound like a guy covered in bells falling down a staircase that's also made of bells.\nI know you've had a hard month, I know you don't have a job, but, God, they're just kids.\nAlso, what happened to the refrigerator and the sofa?\nDid we get robbed by giants?\nYou know what sucks about getting older?\nYour friends have known you for way too long.\nThey've got too much on you.\nYep.\nI want friends who still lie to me,\n'cause they don't want to hurt my feelings.\nMm.\nI sadly kind of mean that.\nWhat happened to us, man?\nWe used to be so cool.\nI was going to play basketball and be a gazillionaire.\n(chuckles):\nRight.

What did you say to me?\nDon't say that right now. You're taking it out of context.\nHe said, \"Winston, is it okay that I didn't get my pants all the way off?\"\nThat's a true story. That really happened.\nI was 16 years old.\nAnd I've gotten a lot better.\nYou haven't gotten that much better. I used to listen to you and Caroline all the time in college.\nIt was like listening to a rescue crew trying to communicate with a stranded miner.\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\"Yeah. Are you okay?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHey, guys, I don't have much time.\nCan we get this back on track?\nI need to know what to do.\nWould flicking be, like, a cool thing?\nNo.\nNo!\nAbsolutely not.\nHow about role play?\nDo you know any voices?\nYes. I can do an old-timey newscaster, like, \"Hey there, son, I'm gonna kick you into next Tuesday, see?\"\n\n\n\nYou're telling me, for the last 15 years, you've been thinking I'm bad at sex. I'm fantastic at sex.\nDude, you're scared to get a haircut.\nYeah, I don't like getting a haircut!\nIt's too intimate. What does that have to do with sex?\nOkay, Jess, here's what you're gonna do.\nYou got a question, just come to me because I'm obviously the best.\nNo, you're not the best.\nJess, who do you think, of the three of us, is the best at sex?\nYes.\nAnd take emotion out of it.\nNo one's feelings are gonna get hurt.\nGo with your gut. - Especially, you know, Nick and Winston's.\nNo, I'm not doing this.\nSay a name.\nGo with your gut.\n(knock on door)\nOh. Oh!\nHey! Paul!\nHey, Paul.\nHey.\nPAUL: Hey.\nHey, goose.\nHey, goose.\n(chuckles)\nJESS: I'm gonna go get ready in my room.\nOkay.\nI'll be back.\nI'll just hang out with the guys.\nCool.\nHey, guys.\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up?\nWhat's up, Paul?\nOh, you're looking at me like, \"what?\"\nI should tell you.\nUm, \"Goose\" is short for\n\"me gusta Jess.\"\nOf course.\nCome here, sit down, man.\nThank you. - I am so tired of people being so careful with me.\nIt's like, I am 40\nand I am pregnant.\nI am not made out of crackers.\n(laughing) (laughs)\nHey, ladies What are you guys talking about?\nAfterbirth.\nAfterbirth.\nThat's like the, the party you guys have after you have the baby...\nSort of. - You know, I'd like to be invited to that.\nYou know what they say,\n\"An afterbirth ain't an afterbirth without some Schmidt up I in there.\"\nSchmidt? Come here.\nI'm gonna talk to you in a little bit.\nWhat are you doing?\nI'm rocking this party, Beth.\nWatch this.\nHi. How's everyboby doing?\nYou know, I just, I just wanted to take a moment to, well, to say how honored I am to celebrate the journey of Bogart through Gina, and out and into the light.\nHere's to elective C-sections!\n(women cheering)\nJust face it, baby.\nYou don't know the first thing about women.\nAh, you're the best, Beth. I don't know if you know this about me, but I was in two frats in college.\nWant to know why?\n'Cause I just couldn't decide.\nHey, ladies! Let's get this party started!\n(cheering)\n \nWe're all getting drunk tonight! Except for you, Gina.\nHorribly irresponsible.\n(classical piano plays)\nSo, I'm looking forward to having sex tonight.\nYeah. Me, too.\nsex is the bomb.\n(chuckles)\nSorry. That sounded like a guy from Entourage.\nDo you like p0rn?\nNo. Do you?\nYeah, I mean, I... Yeah.\nI do, I do like pornos.\nYeah, you know, when my imagination isn't really working...\nor I've exhausted, uh, the bullpen.\nI just find it very erotic.\nAnd then I just love, like...\neverything that's erotic.\n \nSCHMIDT:\nYeah, party!\nParty, yeah!\nYeah, Gina!

Definitely.\nSit down.\nOkay.\nWhoa, wow.\n(imitates old-timey newscaster):\nYou are hot, hot, hot.\nThank you. Hello, weather service? Oh!\nThere's a heat wave from Portsmouth to Port, Kansas!\nI don't know, I don't... what is happening.\nWe're talking dirty, slim.\nOh, okay. You want me to do... you're doing a voice.\nYou want me to do a voice? Okay, um...\nWell, I'm so happy to be here!\nJimmy Stewart?\n(as Jimmy Stewart):\nYou look ravishing in your...\nnetting...\nThank you very much.\n...contraption.\nNow, why don't you let me see your little caboose?\nOkay, here. Let me go ahead and...\nYour caboose.\nOh, okay.\nYour butt.\nOh, my butt! Okay.\nHere's my caboose!\nOh, happy birthday, me!\nI... Oh.\nOh, my God, oh, my God.\nI'm so sorry. Is that okay?\nNo, it was great.\n(as Jimmy Stewart): I just it felt so good, and sensual.\nHey!\nYou want me to wiggle it around?\nHow about you help me get a little more comfortable?\nOh. Oh, all right, dear.\nOkay, I just don't know...\nI'm going to try something different.\nOh.

So nice.\n(choking):\nSo nice...\n(Paul choking)\nAh, you're hurting me.\nOh, my God!\n(gasping)\nOh, God.\nAre you okay?\nOh, yeah, I'm good, I'm good!\n(gasping)\nLet me get you some water.\nYeah, yeah. I'm gonna get some water at home.\nI-I have good water at home.\nNo, no, no, I have water here.\nI have a filter, it's a special ionized filter...\nI got at home.\nOh, I'm so glad you convinced me to go to your barbershop.\nWow, man. I... it actually looks really good.\nRight? I look good.\nAnd I loved it in there. You think they liked me in there?\nI think they loved you in there, man.\nNICK:\nOkay, good.\nHow'd it go?\nIs he still in there, Jess?\nNo more tea.\nI forgot to buy tea.\n(softly):\nHello.\nWhere's...\nwhere's the door?\nHey.\nWhat's up, Jess?\nYou okay, Jess?\nI messed up.\nHe ran away. He got scared.\nWhy would he be scared?\nBecause I choked him.\nI lightly choked him.\nWow.\nThat's what happens when you listen to Schmidt.\nIt's just... when I was with Spencer, I just didn't even think about this stuff, you know?\nJust did it.\nOkay.\nHere's the thing.\nYou gotta stop thinking about it.\nJust relax, and be yourself.\nYou're awesome.\nWhat do you think, Winston?\nWhy are you asking Winston?\nBecause, Nick, look at your hair.\nYou really don't look like someone who's good at sex.\nI can't believe you just said that.\nHere's what you do. You're gonna stop worrying about it.\nCompletely.\nYeah. That's really good.\nThat's literally what I just said.\nWhat are you worried about, anyway?\nPaul doesn't care what you do.\nI've seen the way that boy looks at you.\nAnd he is crazy about you.\nI agree, I...\nShh.\nI'm trying to listen to Winston.\n(knocking on door)\nOh, hi!\nHi.\nPaul.\nHey, Winston.\nCould I talk to you for a minute?\nYeah.\nWe'll... step into my office.\nOkay. Hey, Nick.\nNICK: Okay.\nUm...\nHi.\nHi.\nSo, last night was, um...\nNo, I'm so sorry.\nNo, no, don't, please...\nUnacceptable.\nI'm really intimidated by you, Jess.\nYou're so experienced, and I've never done any of that stuff, that S and M style... bondage stuff.\nIt scares me a little, but I...\nwant to do it, because I know that you're into it.\nJust please be gentle with me at first, okay?\nI really like you.\nReally?\nYeah, I do.\nAnd nothing else matters.\n(sighs)\nExcept, just...\nno fire, and no handcuffs, please. Please, please, please.\nOkay? And I'm allergic to felt.\nAnd most polyurethanes.\nOkay, well, that's it.\nAnd no bugs, too, I don't know if that was...\n(elevator bell dings) Paul.\nWait. Um...\nLast night was kind of a... low point for me. I mean...\nI'm not really into that stuff. I just... I thought that whatever I used to do wouldn't be good enough, or sexy enough, or advanced enough, and that's why I did that...\nOh no!\nSorry. - Oh, no. No, it's okay, it just surprised me a little bit.\nI just...\nI like you.\nWell, good.\nI'll walk you down.\nOkay.\nOh! Um, the new trombones came in...\nPaul...\n(gasping, kissing)\n(emergency stop alarm buzzes)\nYou know that doesn't speed it up when you do that.\nI know, I know.\n(elevator bell dings)\nWe're about to go see a movie.\nYou guys want to come?\nSure.\nSure.\nHey, Jess? Is that your shoe?\nBoy, your haircut look like a high-rise.\n(laughing)\nWhere the penthouse at?\nHey, old man, what, did you steal those pants off of Danny Glover's grandfather?\n(Nick laughing)\nI am Danny Glover's grandfather.\nI'm a big fan of his work.\nHe's great in the Lethal Weapons.\nNo, I'm not.\n(laughing)\n"}, {"title": "01x09 - The 23rd.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nI can't believe Jess got roller skates for Christmas.\nI feel so free.\nDon't. See this.\n\"Merry Christmas, Brendan. Don't swallow these. Love, Uncle Nick.\"\nIt's a great gift. He's a 12-year-old kid, it's a bunch of tacks. He's going to love 'em.\nGive it to me.\nI hate Christmas.\nFirst of all, it means that Hanukkah is over.\nSecond of all, I hate it when you guys leave and go home.\nWhen are you leaving?\nTomorrow at 3:00 p.m.\nI think 4:00 a.m.\nIs that it? Schmidt, don't worry about it, man, we're all gonna hang out tonight at your office party.\nPlease tell me you're not dressing up like Santa this year, are you?\nI'm the only man in the office.\nOf course I'm gonna dress up like Santa.\nLook, I like it.\nI get all this dirt on my coworkers.\nThey get drunk and they whisper what they want for Christmas in my ear, and then I use that information to subtly undermine them and control them for the rest of the year.\nAh, the true spirit of Christmas.\nWinston, you'd better watch it, man, because I will take you down.\nYou want to go? You want to go?\nYou're gonna take me down? I had figure skating lessons until I was 13, and then my mom sobered up and realized I was a boy. Let's do this.\nYou should not have said that. Hey, guys, guys, don't fight.\nLet's go. You're wearing roller skates.\nI'm telling you, man. Both of you, enough, hey, hey.\nNothing's smart about what you guys are doing.\nWhy don't you both act like grown-ups?\nNo, no.\nI need your help right now.\nI need you guys to get in my car and come with me to the mall 'cause I really need to figure out what to buy Paul for...\nYou guys are all wearing the holiday gifts I gave you.\nNo, I...\nThat is so sweet.\nI need to take a picture.\nJess, don't take a photo right now.\nSo cute.\nDon't do the photo.\nPlease, no pictures.\nSo cute, so cute.\nNew Girl S01E09\n\"The 23rd\"\n==DIFUNDE LA PALABRA==\nSo why can't you figure out what to get your boyfriend Paul?\nI don't know.\nMaybe 'cause we've only been going out for, like, a month, so I know it's not something fancy.\nBut do I get him a gag gift or do I get him something sweet?\nI don't know.\nWell, I think you got to figure out what you feel about him and then get a gift that reflects it.\nI think that's kind of the move.\nMy initial thought was to get him a gift certificate for piping hot sex.\nReally... oh, you're being serious?\nBut I don't want him to think that I'm using him for his body.\nI'm sure he'd be okay with that.\n\"Nerdy weird sex that works for both of us.\"\nGive it back.\nThis is amazing.\nNo, come on.\nI'm gonna keep this.\nI'm gonna cash this in one night and get some weird nerd sex with it.

It's going right to my mom.\nWhy do we have to go to this office party tonight?\nBecause it's the last night before you guys go home to your families, and we got to blow this thing out, man.\nPlus, it'll be a good opportunity for you to do some networking.\nHelp with the job search.\nI'm telling you, everybody's hitting the nog, having a good time, letting loose.\nYou swoop in there, and then boom... new job, man.\nThat's how things work.\nYou know, Benjamins in your pocket, La Pen-si-own, little four-to-the-oh-\nto-the-one-to-the-kay.\nYou're making me want to stay broke.\nSo what'd you get Paul?\nI'm not telling you, but, um, I'll give you a hint.\nIt's fuzzy.\nWell, I hope you didn't listen to Nick.\nHe's the worst gift giver ever.\nYou're welcome.\nWhere are we, Jess?\nWe are on Candy Cane Lane.\nAt night, the whole block lights up\nwith Christmas decorations.\nIt's so beautiful.\nOh, my God, it's so beautiful.\nWhat fun, what wonderful fun.\nOkay, whatever.\nWe have to come back later\n'cause you'll see what I'm talking about.\nOh, no, we're not gonna have time.\nWe have to go straight from the party to the airport.\nNo.\nYes, I've missed my flight four years in a row.\nIf I miss it this year, my mom's gonna kill me.\nSchmidt, it's a menorah for you.\nOh, a menorah.\nJudaism, son.\nHey, hi.\nYou look awesome.\nIt's a before and after for a Bolivian diet pill.\nEl Glatrax? Yeah, I've taken that.\nI'm \"before.\"\nSu-Sure, you are, look at that.\nSo you said you wanted to see me for something?\nYes, I brought you a gift.\nI hope you appreciate that I have kept eye contact with you this whole time and made no reference to the fact that you are basically naked.\nVery proud of you, Schmidt.\nHey, hey.\nOh, lot of tongue.\nDone with her hair? With her...?\nNo, I'm not the hair guy, man.\nOh, no, no, no, this is my very good friend Schmidt, and he just came by to bring me a gift, so...\nIt's perfume.\nWhy does it say \"Cecilia Number 5\"?\nActually, it says that because... you know, I ma... I made it specifically for you.\nYeah, I found this place on Third Street where you can design your own perfume.\nBase notes of cocoa because of your brown, uh...\nness.\nSea salt, because it kind of sounds like Cece.\nUh, and sandalwood...\nSandalwood... always up to no good.\nThat's, um...\nHa.\nThank you. Yeah.\nThanks. Neat.\nLet's get back to work.\nYeah, okay, um...\nI'll see you tonight.\nYeah. Yeah, I'll just... I'll see you there.\nWe'll do that.\nThree, two, one.\nGo.\nEnvelope.\nFestive bag. I was afraid you were going to get me jewelry, so...\nOh, no.\nWhat is it?\nOh, my God.\nOh, my God, two tickets to Vienna and passes to the Salzburg Music Festival?\nThat's, like, incredible.\nYou're gonna love it.\nI'm speechless.\nAnd, um, all I got you was...\n\"Anatomically correct heart of a 50-year-old nonsmoker.\"\nYou know what?\nNormally I'm, like, really good at giving gifts, and I thought that was romantic, but it's just... so creepy.\nI, I'm sorry, I have to get you something better.\nNo, it's great, I love it.\nIt's funny an-and quirky and, and so sweet.\nIt's like you.\nThat's why I love it.\nI love it.\nThank you, I love it.\nI... I love you.\nThank you.\nYou're very welcome.\nYou're welcome.\nLook at you, all dressed up.\nWhat, are you in The Temptations tonight?\nThat's so cute, Nick, you're intimidated by my style.\nBut I'll tell you what...\none of us is walking out of here with a job.\nWhere you going?\nYou wore my present.\nI did.\nThank you, I love it. Yay.\nShe's seen it now, so maybe you can take it off.\nYou look like a man.\nI know, right? That's what's freaking me out.\nGood humor and fun... God forbid.\nIs that Schmidt?\nOh.\nWhat the...?\nHey, guys.\nWhoa, whoa, Schmidt, Santa voice.\nThis isn't temple.\nHo, ho, ho.\nAre those my shorts?\nHey, what's wrong, Jess?\nHey, Nick.\nPaul told me he loved me.\nHmm. And I couldn't say it back, so I, um, said \"Thank you,\"\nwhich was horrible.\nI don't know what to do because I am always the one who loves more.\nThat's my thing.\nOne time I went on a date and by 11:00 p.m., I gave the guy my ATM code.\nWhat is your ATM code?\n42...\nVery funny.\nVery good try, but no.\nNot a try... I got it.\nIf you don't have feelings for Paul, you got to tell him.\nI can't do that to someone on Christmas.\nAnd then it's New Year's.\nThen it's going to be Valentine's Day and then, whoa, it's Presidents' Day.\nHard to argue with that logic, but just tell him.\nDon't lead him on... you'll just hurt him more.\nOkay.\nI'm gonna do it.\nI'm gonna tell him.\nYou are?\nYeah.\nHey, what are you doing in here?\nKyle's being a jerk.\nWhat are you doing in here?\nEating cookies and avoiding confrontation.\nRemember when Christmas used to be fun and all I had to do was worry about my drunk uncle asking me out?\nYes, Uncle Pardeep.\nHe thought I was a boy.\nSuch a weirdo.\nOkay.\nHey, man.\nHey.\nHow you doing, Paul?\nGood.\nHas Jess not talked to you?\nOh, yeah, no, we talked.\nYeah, yeah, no, I...\nShe did, okay.\nYeah, it's hard, you know, it's really tricky. It's like she doesn't love you right now, Paul, but that's not to say she might not fall in love with you later.\nI think that's the positive way of looking at it, but it's hard, man, believe me.\nWe talked about how we might have to drive you to the airport 'cause you're gonna miss your flight.\nYeah, that was probably all you guys talked about, so I'm joking.\nW-Wait a minute. Because she hasn't...\nYeah, I know... guess what, Paul.\nDon't even think right now.\nI'm drunk.\nDid... Jess tell you... I'm so drunk.\nthat she doesn't love me? What's happ...? No, shut up, you goofball.\nI'm... this conversation didn't happen.\nDid Jess tell you she doesn't love me?\nJoke.\nBut he's the best guy, Cece.\nMaybe I should just make it work.\nYeah, no, Jess, you can't just dive into something like this right now.\nYeah, I just wish I could stay in this bathroom all night.\nMe, too.\nWhoo, that eggnog is deadly.\nWe got to get out of here.\nYeah, we do.\nI should just put it off till later, after the holidays.\nYou coming?\nYeah, I'll be out in a sec.\nKyle wants to go to this party.\nUgh, Kyle is the living worst.\nYeah, I know.\nDid he even get you a gift?\nNo.\nWho wants to sit at a desk all day?\nNot me... I don't want to have to do that.\nI don't want to call Wednesday \"hump day.\"\nI don't even know how to network.\nSo what's your deal, man?\nWhy are you sitting here by yourself?\nMommy won't let me sit in Santa's lap.\nYou have a smart mommy.\nYeah.\nHi, I'm the genius who brought my kid to this Christmas party.\nLooking forward to years of therapy over Dirty Santa.\nI can't believe that he's even talking to you.\nHe doesn't like anyone.\nYeah, I don't like anyone.\nYeah, but we're really working on that.\nNo, she's working on that.\nMy man.\nOkay? You think it's fun?\nDo it. I do think it's fun.\nDo it then.\nDo it.\nOkay.\nWhat are you doing, Santa?\nI have a really bad case of Santa lap.\nThe entire marketing department is wearing wool.\nIt's not good down there.\nWell, get back to work soon.\nBoom! Ow! Why would you...?\nThere are so many bobby pins up there.\nEverything's attached... Does she always talk to you like that?\nYeah, kind of.\nYou like dressing up like Santa?\nSexy Santa.\nNo. The truth is, no, I don't.\nYou know, you don't deserve to be treated like that.\nYou just got to tell her no.\nOtherwise, all she'll do is see you as a pretty face and a hot body.\nI'm sorry, what was that?\nYou have a pretty face.\nNo, no, no, 'cause the second part.\nAnd I'd like you to say it, like, in an accent, but make direct eye contact. Yes, Schmidt, do not push your luck with me.\nWhat's that smell?\nThat's your perfume.\nYou wore it?\nYeah, and it smells terrible.\nHa!\nIt does smell terrible.\nIt's like a dirty dish towel.\nSanta voice!\nPlease just tell me what she said.\nShe said the sex is really great, but she just doesn't want to jump into anything.\nWhy am I talking about this? Oh, my God, the sex is great, it's amazing.\nGreat. We had amazing sex this morning, and then we ate Taro chips.\nOh, my God. Oh, oh. Oh, God. I... I feel like such a terrible guy for saying that to you, man.\nOh, my God. You're a good guy, Genzlinger.\nHey, man, just let it go.\nYou know what I mean? Just let it brush off your shoulders, dude. Oh, man.\nWhat has happened to my life? Hey.\nWhy are you guys hugging?\nJust guy-talkin'. Yeah.\nYeah? Everything's fine.\nWe're just talking. Just talking.\nAbout, uh... how moved we are... by jazz music.\nThat's a lie.\nI told him you didn't love him, Jess.\nWhat?! Because I...\nBut he said it nicely.\nAre you kidding me?!\nIt's not your information to share. I totally agree, and I regret it. It is not your information...\nWhy would you do that?\nI apologize.\n\n\n\nYou guys have a lot to do. I'm sorry. Nick. Nick.\nOh, my God.\nPlease! This is my nightmare!\nWinston!\nSchmidt!\nHelp me...!\nPaul, I really care about you.\nI think I just... I think I just feel really overwhelmed.\nYeah. Yeah, I know, Nicholas told m...\nDamn it.\nHey, guys, just pretend I'm not here, and just do whatever you two guys are doing.\nI'm not here. I'm not even listening.\nThis is my nightmare.\nI-I knew you were getting out of a long relationship.\nYou told me all about Spencer. I just thought...\nI thought we were feeling the same things for each other.\nYou seemed like you were.\nI was. I just...\nI feel like maybe you were feeling them a little bit more than me.\nNick!\nYou started this.\nSit down and be quiet!\nI just... I got really hurt, and I... I'm trying really hard not to get hurt again.\nI'm not gonna hurt you.\nOh.\nOh...\nI am so sorry.\nThis is as rude as it gets.\nIt is my mom, though.\nI... Hey, Ma. How you doing?\nI can't talk right now.\nI'm in a real weird situation.\nNo, Ma, I'm not high... I'm done with that phase.\nI promise you I won't miss my flight.\nOkay. I love you, Mama. Bye.\nYou done?\nCan we just...\ncan we just keep going but take it a little bit slow?\nI-I don't know if I can do that.\nI don't know how with you.\nIt's just not how I feel. Well, all she's asking you to do is slow it down a little bit.\nHow's that hard?\nNick.\nYeah.\nAll right, everybody leave the room.\nI need to talk to Kim.\nOkay, you know what? Actually, stay... this'll be good for you guys to hear this, too.\nWhy d... Don't...\nCome on.\nI just told...

Santa's dead.\nI killed him.\nOh, my God.\nNo, no, no, don't worry, that's just Gina's cowardly son.\nHe is a scream machine.\nKim, I'm not a sex object, all right?\nI'm your employee.\nAnd I work harder than anyone.\nI'm the first one to show up every morning.\nNo, you're not.\nThere's never a parking space.\nThat's because everyone's already here, Nick.\nOkay, you're so off topic right now.\nYou're missing the point. What?\nYou need to take me seriously, Kim.\nDoes that mean no more...\nSexy Easter Bunny?\nNo Sexy Easter Bunny.\nWhat about, uh, Cinco de Sexy?\nNo Cinco de Sexy.\nAnd no Sexy Martin Luther King?\nI could never get the voice, I never really felt like I had the authority...\nI can't believe it took you five years to say that.\nWell, I guess I'm gonna have to be Sexy Santa next year.\nYeah, just got to jingle bell rock.\nYou know what I mean?\nThat is so inappropriate.\nI get it... so you can dish it out but you can't take it.\nYeah, how's that feel, Kim?\nI like it.\nBoth these machines need toner.\nThey need... I'm gonna put the toner in the...\nin the machine.\nMrs. Miller, I told you, I will get Nick to his flight on time.\nNo worries.\nI can't find Elvin. I've looked everywhere.\nI-I have no idea. Uh, you know what?\nI got to go. Um, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.\nWe'll find him.\nElvin!\nI'll tell you what, you go that way, I'll go that way.\nThis is Schmidt's fault. I don't know how, but it is.\nElvin?\nI'm sorry, Jess, I just...\nI don't want to slow down... with you.\nIt's just not natural. So if you need to, then...

You never know.\nA judge might buy into this whole thing, so...\nWhat \"whole thing\"?\nYour whole thing.\nWith the cupcakes, and the braking for birds, and... bluebirds come and help me dress in the morning.\nOh, I didn't know I was doing a thing.\nIt's a great thing. I mean, the big, beautiful eyes, like a scared baby.\nI'm sure that gets you out of all kinds of stuff.\nYeah. Yeah, except my peripheral vision's, like, almost too good.\nHey, so...\nliving here, it's probably fun, right?\nYeah. There are, like, lots of girls coming in and out of this place?\nSchmidt's like Ellis Island in the 1800s.\nHe accepts everyone.\nYeah, and... Winston and Nick...\nI probably shouldn't...\nOh, yeah. Well, you don't have to... Plead the Fifth!\nNo, that's not what... Objection!\nNick, hey! Hey, Julia!\nYou want to hang out in your room? Sure.\nJess, if you'll excuse us, Julie's about to be very disappointed.\nOkay, so I will look at this stuff some more, I-I'll call some people, see what I can do.\nHere's your blankie back.\nPower blazer. Hey. Ha ha.\nWhat's going on with the ticket?\nShe has a problem with me, Nick.\nOkay? She doesn't like me. What are you talking about?\nYou don't understand,\n'cause you're a guy.\nShe does not have a problem with you. She's just...\nNick, your girlfriend's not a dessert person.\nHmm.\nShe said you have\n\"a whole thing\"?\nI'm sorry, she doesn't like desserts?\nWhere is she right now?\nLook, I think I know what she meant.\nI mean, you do like girly stuff.\nI mean, it kind of freaked me out at first.\nWhen I met you, you were wearing a hat made of ribbons.\nMy ribbon hat. I love that hat.\nScrew her. And I'm gonna wear that ribbon hat.\nGo get it, right now.\nBe right back.\nWhoa. There she is.\nNick, where is this bitch?\nGonna smack that lawyer learning right out of her mouth.\nOkay, this is getting excessive, guys.\nShe's actually helping her get out of a ticket.\nBy being condescending and judgmental?\nWhat did she say?\nUgh, just drop it, Nick.\nOkay, what did Julia do wrong?\nIt's just how girls fight sometimes.\nThere's a lot unsaid.\nLike one time, a girl said to me,\n\"Jess, you rock a lot of polka dots.\"\nOoh. How did she say it?\n\"Jess, you rock a lot of polka dots.\"\nThat is diabolical. I'm really sorry.\nAnd it ruined our friendship.\nI mean, I couldn't get over the polka dot incident.\nWarning! Spoiler alert.\nSomebody unplugged my dehumidifier to plug in their flatiron.\nI will be putting my dehumidifier, and my towel, in my room, where nothing ever gets wet.\nAll right, you know what, Jess? Julia's one of those girls where she doesn't have, like, a lot of girl friends.\nBecause she thinks like a guy. She doesn't play mind games.\nSo blind! Look, all I know is she's totally up front with me.\nNo subtext, no codes.\nOh. Okay. So did she come right out and ask you if you were seeing other girls?\nBecause... she asked me.\nShe did? You didn't know that?\n'Cause I thought you guys were so up front with one another.\nI thought you guys told each other everything. Yeah.\nShe told him she didn't want to label it.\nOh. I mean, that's a classic move, even in the lesbian community.\nWhat are we talking about?\nDid you just hear the phrase\n\"lesbian community\"\nand come running out of your room?\nI did. Uh...\nquestion, for you.\nThis community you speak of, do the ladies look, uh...\nmore like this one or, you know...\nkind of Nickish? Aw, shut up, Schmidt.\nI did date a woman who looked a lot like Nick.\nYou did. Felicia.\nWhy can't you just admit that she's your girlfriend?\nI know, I just thought it was uncomplicated, and now I'm freaking out.\nI'm not good at being a boyfriend.\nI'm good at being that guy that you find yourself spending more and more time with until you meet your husband.\nAll right. So, so far, Nick Miller's list of fears is sharks, tap water, real relationships.\nAnd blueberries. Barkeep.\nGet this man a drink.\nLadies, he hasn't had sex in four months.\nCome and get it, ladies.\nI seriously hate you, Schmidt. Why?\nIt didn't go well with Shelby?\nI gotta say, I thought it would be easy.\nYou know? Maybe...\nmaybe I don't have game. Maybe I never had game.\nMaybe it's always been about basketball.\nYeah, you don't have any game.\nIt's always been because you play basketball.\nAre you seriously just realizing that you don't have game?\nWhat is your secret, man? How do normal guys get girls?\nLet's not say \"normal.\"\nJust, you know, say what it is ... \"average.\"\nYou've had the most game, out of any of us.\nBecause for years now, you've been working with absolutely nothing.\nHe makes a good point. Okay.\nI've been working with nothing. Zilch.\nYou're right, I've got nothing.\nExcept this.\nOw.\nOh, my God.\nMiller! No Cocktail!\nSorry, Julio.\nJulia! Hey, Julia!\nHey.\nOoh. You guys are using names?\nThat's not too labelly for you?\nHey. Hey, hey, Jules.\nHey.\nThought I'd drop by and say hello.\nOh, I didn't know we were doing drop-bys.\nUh...\nHere's a scenario that's paid sexual dividends, particularly in the Asian markets, and I think, Jess, you can back me up on this.\nInform her that you're an aerialist for the Cirque du Soleil.\nWinston, just ask questions, pay attention to her, listen to her, don't listen to him.\nOh, believe me, I don't take advice from Schmidt.\nNever have, never will. Ever.\nSo Jess told me what you asked her yesterday. What?\nThat you asked if I was sleeping with other people.\nThat is not even... I... what?\nI don't want to play games. That's not what happened, okay?\nI just said something to h, because I was feeling kind of guilty, because I'm, uh...\nI'm dating other people, and I just, you know... wanted to see if you were also dating other people.\nYou're dating other people?\nYeah, yeah.\nNo. No, I'm seeing other people, too.\nGood. Good.\nI'm having sex all the time. I'm like a mailman.\nExcept instead of mail, it's hot sex that I deliver.\nI've had to start carrying, like, athletic shoes in my purse, 'cause I have to sprint from one sexual encounter to another.\nCan't wear heels.\nWell, I'm having sex right now.\nUnder the bar.\nAnd she's on top.\nSo figure that out.\nWas that her?\nYeah.\nWell, great. Great.\nThen we're both doing the exact same thing.\nAnd we're on the same page.\nKudos for not putting labels on things.\nThat is exactly what I want. It's my dream.\nJust going to go to the bathroom really quickly.\nOkay. Great.\n\n\n\nHey. Julia?\nAre you serious?\nDid Nick say some stuff to you?\nBecause I'm really sorry, and I want to explain...\nWhy would you tell him that I said that?\nDo you know what that makes me look like?\nUm...\nI see what you're doing.\nI know that I'm the mean lawyer girl who wears suits and works too much and you... you're the really fun teacher girl with all the colorful skirts and you bake things.\nAnd eventually, Nick is going to come running to you and you'll tuck him in under his blankie and...\nWhat is it with you and the blankie thing?\nI never said the word blankie.\nI don't talk like Teddy Ruxpin.\nIf I acted the way that you act when I was at work, nobody would listen to me.\nWell, if I acted like you at work, my students would turn in really weird, dark dioramas, so...\nI don't like you.\nAnd I don't want to be your friend, so...\nFine. Can you leave, please?\nBecause...\nI am about to start crying, and you are the last person that I want to cry in front of.\nI want to cry, t, and...\nwhere am I supposed to cry?\nYou can't monopolize the bathroom crying space.\nPlease go.\nWhat are you doing, Jess?\nGet out! I'm sorry.\nWinston, what are you doing? Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.\nI have come here to listen to you.\nShould I have interrupted you to tell you that?\nProbably not.\nSo how... how are you?\nTell me about your life, and how is everything?\nWinston, what am I supposed to do?\nI was a booty call for two years, and then I was nothing for two years.\nYou show up bragging after all this time like nothing has changed.\nWhat do you want me to think?\nThat I'm an idiot.\nAnd you know what?\nYou're right, and I'm sorry.\nIt's just that since I've stopped playing ball, I realize I'm not that good at this.\nAnd, quite frankly, you are way out of my league.\nThat is clear now.\nBut... I do hope this is not the last time I see you, but whatever you want, I'm cool with.\nI got to get back to work.\nYeah.\nYeah, I'll help you.\nSee?\nI'm the manager.\nOh, you're the manager? Yeah.\nWow, that's amazing. It's okay.\nCase 73.\nMr. Sandoval.\nI see you have dressed for the occasion.\nOh. Hi.\nYou didn't have to come.\nI'm sure you're very busy.\nI said that I would be here, so I'm here. Don't worry.\nI think I can handle it. Let's just get this over with so we can get out of here.\nYour Honor.\nYour Honor.\nYour Honor.\nThese are the facts, Your Honor.\n# Your Honor.\nCase 74 ... Jessica Day.\nYes, sir. Yes, I'm present, sir. Okay, listen.\nYou just have to enter the plea yourself, all right, and then I'll do the rest.\nOkay, okay. I got it, all right?\nSo you know, all you have to do is say... I got it! Thank you.\nOkay. Okay. How do you plead?\nGuilty. What?\nGreat. Pay your fine upstairs.\nWell, I guess we're never going to know if the bird defense works.\nSuch a bummer, too.\nWe have this pool at my office.\nOkay. Hey!\nI got something to say to you, man.\nWhat?\nI brake for birds.\nI rock a lot of polka dots.\nI have touched glitter in the last 24 hours.\nI spend my entire day talking to children.\nAnd I find it fundamentally strange that you're not a dessert person.\nThat's just weird, and it freaks me out.\nAnd I'm sorry I don't talk like Murphy Brown.\nAnd I hate your pantsuit.\nI wish it had ribbons on it or something to make it just slightly cuter.\nAnd that doesn't mean I'm not smart and tough and strong.\nOkay.\nAnd I know you like Nick, and I'm not trying to interfere, but you should just talk to him about it.\nAre you done?\nI am almost done.\nI'm about to go and pay this $800 fine, and my checks have baby farm animals on them, bitch.\nThat's the wrong way.\nYou moved.\nYou remember my old place?\nThe place in the hood?\nNo.\nIt was hood-adjacent. Whatever.\nSo, um... so this was nice.\nYeah, it was.\nYou want to know what I want to do now?\nWhat?\nTake you on a real date.\nWhy don't you call me?\nGood night, Winston.\nWinston, what's happening? Huh?\nYeah, good night.\nWhat is wrong with you, man?\nYou got no game. That was so stupid.\nHey! Anyone!\nMy towel!\nCan someone please get my towel?\nIt's in my room next to my Irish walking cape.\nThe... the bigger towel.\nNot... do not touch the small one.\nOkay, I left my towel in my room.\nNobody look.\nNobody look, yo.\nWe don't want to. Nobody look.\nSeriously, no... no one's looking?\nAll right, forget it.\nAah! Damn it! See, he's a natural blond.\nWhat shape is that supposed to be shaved into?\nThink he's trying to force perspective.\nVery funny. I got to get something off my chest.\nNo, Schmidt, there is an apron right over there ... go cover yourself.\nYou are Jewish. You're making me gayer.\nAre you going to go on, like, a big wet towel rant?\nNo. This is now a sex rant.\nTo wit, six months ago, I thought getting a girl roommate would mean sex all the time ...\ndefinitely with her friends and probably with her.\nAre there women here?\nYeah, sure, more than ever.\nBut you ... not going to happen.\nYou, I will never give up.\nAnd you... well, you sample from the gumbo pot.\nI am in a damp bathroom full of naked women every day, and I hate it.\nIt's like a nightmare. I'm in a...\nwatermelon-themed apron with a...\nA tampon?\nWhy would you need this for cooking?\nI just had an idea.\nWhy don't we hang our towels on towel bars instead of hooks, and that'll make them dryer?\nThat is the...\nthat is... that is a great idea.\nQuick question for you.\nAs a lesbian gynecologist, perhaps, one of these days, the two of us could sit down and talk about OSI.\nWhat is OSI? Our shared interest.\nSchmidt, clothe yourself! All right, all right.\nIt was just a suggestion.\nOh.\nHey. Hi.\nNick's not here.\nThat's okay.\nUh, because I came here to...\nwell, I kind of came because I-I thought it would be good if you and I...\nHey, Jess, my hands are actually stuck in the yarn because... Oh.\nI didn't realize that you had people over. Sorry.\nNo, it's just... crochet time.\nYeah.\nNick's not here right now. No, I know.\nThanks.\nI'll just come back later.\nHey, Julia.\nDo you want to crochet with us?\nI mean, growing up was brutal.\nI went to an all-girls school.\nThe worst ... girls can be so mean to each other.\nYeah, Cece and I hid in the bathroom for four years.\nThis is... this is really nice, guys.\nThank you for letting me join in.\nIt's totally relaxing.\nExcept that I don't know why, if I put the fox through the cave, it doesn't... the yarn is broken.\nI don't know why this is not turning into...\nWhat you making?\nA hat.\nIf you're making a hat for a baby, it is done.\nYeah.\nHey, Julia.\nWhat are you doing here?\nCould I talk to you for a second?\nOkay.\nHey, Julia.\nStop.\nNo, there's something that I need to say to you.\nAll right. Then go ahead.\nOkay. Okay.\nI'm going to say it.\nOkay, I... Just say it.\nAll right. I-I wanted to say that...\nI don't want to date anybody else.\nI just want to date you.\nWell, that's what I was going to say to you.\nReally? Yeah.\nSo, then... so, then, what does that mean?\nYou're, like, my boyfriend now?\nI'm not really into labels.\nYeah, all right.\nBoyfriend.\nThat's so lame.\nYou're totally going to...\ncarry my books home from school.\nI will if you wear my leatherman jacket.\nIt's \"letterman\" jacket. No, I'm pretty sure it's a leatherman jacket. You letter...\nThe leather sleeves that the football guys wear?\nI'm right. I'm right.\nI'm glad you pitched a fit, because my towel is very dry.\nI didn't pitch a fit. I just...\nDamp!\nDamn it!\nEverybody ... bathroom now!\nWhat's up, Dad?\nWhat, Schmidt? Is someone playing a joke on me?\nHonestly, why is my towel still damp?\ncause it's not your towel;\nit's my towel, Schmidt.\nNo, it's not your towel. Your towel is the red one.\nI'll tell you this, pal.\nI've never used that.\nI do use that one every single day.\nOh, God.\nThis towel's so warm and fluffy.\nIt's like it's been in the sun forever.\nThis means you two have been drying your junk with the same towel. Intimate.\nAre you out of your mind?! What do you mean, am I...\nHow do you think this is your towel? Do you even wash it?\nNo, I don't wash the towel;\nthe towel washes me.\nWho washes a towel?\nYou never wash...? You wash your towel?\nYou never wash the towel? What am I going to do?\nWash the shower next? Wash a bar of soap?\nYou got to think here, pal. I'm furious right now.\nI get out of the damn shower, I'm clean as a damn baby, and I use the towel. Let me ask you this.\nHave you been wearing my underpants?\nSometimes, yeah. Who cares?\nYou guys don't wear each other's underpants?\nYou're lying.

Want to grab some brunch?\nSure, Janine, that sounds fun.\nGod ... no, you don't want to grab brunch.\nOkay.\nCome on, damn it, Nick.\nI'm all turned around.\nFocus.\nI just had sex with Janine.\nI have feelings for her.\nYeah, so you're done.\nOh, I just sleep with her and then kick her out like she's a piece of meat?\nThis is the problem.\nAll right, ask me again, Schmidt.\nOkay, cowboy, want to saddle up and go again?\nNo, sweetie, I can't.\nGood ... why can't you?\nI got things to do. I got plans. - You have work.\nPlans can be canceled.\nI don't want to live in a house of lies.\nI can't do it any more.\nIs this happening, too?\nNo, this is not happening.\nNo, this is not happening.\nThis isn't what it looks like.\nOkay, look, fine, from now on, we are going to be open and honest in this loft, and that means that I have some secrets I want to get off my chest.\nI'd rather not hear those.\nNobody wants to hear these.\n\n\n\nSchmidt, a couple months ago I found Nick using your chenille throw as a napkin.\nThat is a microfiber blend from Pakistan, you heathen.\nStop quoting the catalog like a weirdo.\nEach heirloom-quality...\nGood, this is healthy. Air it out.\nAll right, one more.\nSchmidt said that Winston is in danger of becoming a nanny for life.\nHe said you were going \"full Poppins.\"\nOkay, Winston, I can see anger in your eyes.\nSchmidt said he thinks about you sometimes when he's making love to himself.\nWhat?\nOne time.\nWhat?!\nI thought about bangs and your face just appeared beneath them.\nOkay, by the way, like I'm the only one.\nNick told me it happened to him, like, like, a bunch of times.\nWinston, you told me the first week you got back from Latvia, you had a sex dream about Jess, and she had raccoon hands.\nDreams do not count.\nYou've all thought about me while self-completing?\nYeah. Yeah.\nLook, Jess, it's not that big a deal.\nReally, it's, it's the sincerest form of flattery.\nWe're going back to keeping secrets.\nWhen I walk through this door and into my room, this conversation never happened.\nOh, my God!\nSo, what did the raccoon hands look like?\nOh, man, they were digging through the garbage.\nOh, my God!\nDo not drink my almond milk when you spent the whole night drinking Schmidt.\nWhy are you dressed like a Mexican wrestler?\nBecause Cece, I don't want to live in a world with secrets.\nAnd that means that I now know my three roommates have all thought about me while self-completing.\nSo, I'm gonna wear my winter clothes until I can deal with that fact.\nBut it's better than not knowing.\nIs it really better?\nYeah, it is.\nJess, I don't want to fight with you any more, okay?\nI said I was sorry.\nWe tell each other everything. We always have.\nI've never not told you something.\nThat's what second base means?\nThen I'm not a virgin any more.\nIs it weird that he wants me to talk in a deep voice and call myself Kevin?\nI had a dream that I killed you.\nYou tell me everything, all right?\nI stopped telling you everything because every time I did, you got so judgmental and critical.\nWhat?!\nI had to give it a try, Jess.\nI mean, that was the same hand that was inside Elmo.\nCece.\nOkay, yeah, you got me.\nYou don't have secrets, Jess, because you never do anything stupid.\nLook at me!\nWith guys.\nSo, living with Spencer for six years was not a mistake?\nCece, I'm not judging you.\nIt's just... Schmidt?\nJudging. See what that is?\nNo. I'm not judging until now.\nDon't look at me!\nOh, Jess, would you please!\nA winter hat is not gonna make us stop thinking about you from time to time when we delight ourselves.\nOh, no!\nHey, could you guys keep it down? I have a lady visitor.\nHi, Nick.\nOh, I get it.\nIt's actually kind of a fantasy of mine.\nCan you say the following words out loud?\n\"The ice roads are too dangerous!\nYou're gonna have to turn back, Chief.\"\nI'm not saying that.\nOkay.\nI want my scarf.\nIt is 62 degrees out, and I am freezing.\nNo. I had work. I-I have plans. I...\nGet in there! Come on!\nCan I just pay you for the scarf?\nFine. $25.\n25...! No, I'll just help you look for it.\nNick, where'd you go?\nAre you kidding me? No, no, no. It's a bear.\nThere's a magic bear in there! That's all it is is a magic bear. Just stop. Just...\nHey, Nick.\nWho is this?\nCan I have this circle scarf?\nIt's my scarf.\nNo.\nIt's my scarf!\nIt's mine!\nIt's mine! It's mine!\nNick, I just want you to know that I am not judging you right now.\nOh, yeah. Right, sure.\nLadies, let's not do this.\nAt least not with our shirts on.\nDo you know how many things I haven't told you?\nNol I don't, because, apparently, I don't know you at all.\nAre you running a 10K tomorrow?\nWho knows? Are you even against MS any more?\nBeats me!\nOw! Ow! Ow!\nThey've stopped hitting each other, and they're just hitting me!\nAll right, you want to go? This New Year's, I wasn't at my parents' house.\nI was down in St. Barths with a guy who might be an arms dealer.\nAnd my feet aren't whiter than yours.\nI just told you that to make you feel better.\nAnd when we were ten years old, I went to the movie My Girl\nwith Jessica P before I saw it with you!\nOw! Ow! Ow!\nAnd... I own a motorcycle.\nJessica P?!\nJessica freaking P?\nOh, my God, are you crying under there now?! - No! No!\nI think you are.\nNo, I am not.\nAll right, everybody stop!\nWherever you are right now, just sit down!\nOkay, now, Saturday is a day for sleeping, and damn it, you will not take that away from me!\nYou ... give her her scarf back.\nFinders keepers is not a thing.\nYou ... get out of my house!\nWho are you?\nWho am I?\nWho am I? Well, I am Theodore K. Mullins.\nAnd Nick is my lover on the down low.\nTell her, Nick. Tell her how it really goes down in apartment 4D.\nOh, great Negro spiritual, please come down and loose these chains on this woman!\nFlesh on flesh.\nWhen the lights are off, we are all the same.\nNot true.\nDear lord, help me, Father!\nGet out of my house.\nGet out of my house!\nYeah. I'm out.\nI'm leaving.\nHey, can you give me a ride?\nGet out.\nI'm gonna stop and get a manicure.\nDo you want to...?\nOkay. Yeah.\nYou told Harpo to beat me?\nBye, guys.\nYou want them over me?\nOver me?! You...\nYou're sweating so much, it looks like rain, and you...\nYou, you're peaking, man.\nYou're at the prime of your life. That's actually...\nCece, get rid of the motorcycle! And Jess, don't act like you haven't thought about us, too, when you're going solo.\nOkay? I don't work a\n9:00-to-5:00. I'm here all day.\nI can hear you!\nNow, go away, because I'm... having cereal.\nRunners, take their marks.\n Around with them \n I don't want to walk around with them \n 'Cause I don't want to walk around with them \n Ooh, ooh, ooh \n I don't want to walk around with them \n Ooh, ooh, ooh \n I don't want to walk around with them... \nWhy do all female runners look like old German women when they run?\nOh, boy, look at her glisten!\nOh, Cece.\nThat sports bra is doing God's work right now.\nTwo months. - I can't stop. I got to beat Jess.\nWhat are you...? What is wrong with you, sir?\nThat is Cece's water!\nYou animal!\nThis thing with our girls has gotten out of control.\nOur girls?\nYeah, it makes me really sad to see them fighting over me like this.\nThen why are you smiling?\nHave you guys... seen... Cece?\nYeah, she's way down there.\nHasn't even broken a sweat.\nJess, okay. Jess, arms up.\nArms up. I need you long and loose like sea grass.\nMoving. Move...\nOh, my God, why?!\nI'm sorry.\nI'm just mad at you.\nMy adrenaline is going.\nDid you make that?\nWhat?\nAnd Cece let you wear it?\nWhat? She thought it was funny.\nCece! Cece?\nCece!\nWhat's that about, man?\nI mean, I think the shirt's pretty funny, no?\nNot funny at all.\nPuns are creepy, and they freak me out, and you know that. - I like it.\nNick!\nOh, no, no, no.\nI hooked up with both those girls last week.\nI didn't know they knew each other. I thought they just lived in the same apartment.\nWhy didn't you call me? - Why didn't you tell me you hooked up with my roommate?\nI don't...\nWillow, I didn't call you because I had a family emergency.\nIs everything okay?\nYes, it is.\nAnd Megan, I didn't tell you about Willow because the moment we had was so beautiful and intense, that for a second I thought we were the only people on the planet.\nOh. Okay.\nWell, we'll see you later.\nBye.\nBye, guys.\nIt worked.\nWhere did that come from?\nI don't know. I'm trembling, but it worked.\nThat was so good my pants just got tight, Nick.\nOh, God, now I hate me as much as I've always hated you. - Skin.\nSee, I have to do this now.\nNo, you don't. Don't do it.\nYes, I do. - Skin. All you have to do is just not do it.\nI have to. No, because it works.\nCece?\nCece, I can't... breathe.\nCece, I know why you didn't tell me about Schmidt ... because you like him!\nWhat?!\nThe shirt, Cece.\nYou thought the shirt he made was funny.\nYou obviously like him.\nIt's the only explanation for thinking that's funny.\nOh, my God, I think you're right.\nAnd you didn't want to tell me\n'cause you knew that I would know.\nAnd you weren't ready to admit it to yourself.\nOkay, can we just say that I didn't tell you because I'm a total bitch?\n'Cause I'm way more comfortable with that.\nOh, maybe I like Schmidt.\nYou... You can't tell anyone.\nYeah. That's like a secret only I know.\nHeads up.\nI'm-I'm peeing.\nOh, my God.\nOkay, come on. We got to finish.\nOh! No!\nOh, come on, man. Come on, dude!\nHey, here they come. Here they come.\nCome on, guys! Let's go!\nCome on, ladies! Be strong!\nCome on! Come on, ladies!\nCome on, guys.\nAll right, let's go!\nCome on...

Come on.\nAll right, Cece, I got her, I got her.\nAll right. Okay, Jess, here we go.\nOkay, Schmidt, grab her feet.\nAll right, there we go.\nLead us away.\nGood job, Jess.\nReal proud of you.\nWhat are you doing to that basil, Cece?\nYou trying to make it confess?\nEasy with the knife, Robespierre.\nI will cut off your weaker fingers, Schmidt, and I'm gonna start with your pinky.\nYou guys are adorable.\nWe are not adorable.\nOkay? We are just two people having casual, successful sex.\nMy bad.\nPlease.\nAll right. I can't stand this heat.\nI gonna get out of the kitchen.\nOw. Ow.\nYou should really stretch, Jess.\nOw.\nYou know, Jess thinking that we're a cute couple is...\nI don't... It's kind of a turnoff.\nHow do we explain to her that this is just... it's just sex?\nMm-hmm.\nWhat is that?\nThat is shoddy workmanship is what that is.\nI'm taking you off prep.\nGo clean the garbanzo beans.\nI'm taking my knife.\nBe careful with that knife.\nIt's from Japan.\nWhy? Why, Cece?\nWhy am I sleeping with Schmidt?\nIs it a pity thing?\nIs he sick?\nAre you working for the government?\nDamn it, he's holding you against your will, isn't he?\nIf he is holding you against your will, blink twice.\nBlink twice.\nAre you tired of being turned on?\nHmm? You have a mole fetish?\nIs it huge?\nI'm sorry. Let me rephrase that.\nIs it huge?\n"}, {"title": "01x20 - Normal.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nJESS: I love these parties.\nI feel like I'm an ambassador, or a spy, or, like, a really high-class prostitute.\nWell, Jess, it's a political fundraiser.\nWho's to say you can't be all three?\nHey, this is... really good.\nI mean, I gotta tell you, I'm really, um...\nHappy.\nHappy.\nIt's like the complete opposite of my marriage.\nI'll give you the opposite of your marriage.\nWhat?\nSorry, I just...\nI've never heard you talk about your ex-wife, and I got really nervous and...\nI tried to flirt information out of you.\nAw...\nSo...\nI haven't been home in a week, and, um...\nunderneath my dress, I'm wearing...\na pair of your boxer briefs that I borrowed slash-stole slash-I'm not giving them back.\nCome on.

Joe Napoli's the worst, man.\nWhat? Man, that is blasphemous.\nHe's the king of sports radio, man.\nI've got an interview with him today, okay?\nHe's hiring a new research assistant.\nHence... the research.\nMy old basketball coach set it up.\nYou know, I'm just trying to figure out how to break it to Elvin.\nYou gotta cut ties with that kid.\nHe freaks me out.\nHe never blinks.\nHe's like a tiny little owl in a shirt.\nHey, guys!\nHey.

It's creepy and thin, just like I like it.\nHow was your sexcation with Russell?\nI did have a lot of sex. Thank you.\nWhat'd you guys do without me? Hit me up with a headline!\nNothing. We played True American.\nWhat?! You played True American without me? - Yes, ma'am.\n(cell phone ringing)\nOh, sorry. It's Cece.\nHey, you!\nTell me everything. How's it going?\nWhere are you? CECE: With Schmidt.\nWhere are you?\nRight here.\nWow.\nI am not used to this yet.\nI'm surprised this one's still standing.\nWe burned through a lot of ideas last night.\nThat's really great.\nWe went deep into the stables...\nYeah. Cool. NICK and WINSTON: Ugh.\nI don't know. It's like we're living in a romantic comedy montage.\nLike, we, like, throw our heads back when we laugh, and I, like, try on floppy hats for him.\nIt's pretty perfect.\nIt's like the first act of a TV movie until I find out that he has a wife and kids in another state.\nYeah, but nothing's perfect, right?\nYou're kind of doing everything on his terms, living in his beautiful, fancy house...\nI'm not really living there.\nHas he ever spent a night here?\nHey, guys.\nSo, listen, um...\nRussell's gonna come and stay this weekend.\n(groans)\nI was just wondering if you guys could be cool?\nYeah.\nSure. JESS: Okay, uh...\nActually, I don't trust what\n\"cool\" means to all of you, so how about we just say\n\"be normal\"?\nBig R.\nSchmidt.\nYour shoe's untied.\nOh.\nWhat are you doing?\nLabel check, man.\nWhat are you doing?\nLabel check.\nWhat are you doing?\nJust calm down.\n(sighs)\nDid...\n(chuckles)\nI got it.\n(flushes)\nRussell!\nWhoa!\nOh, man, you scared me.\nYou scared of black people?\nNo.\nIt's 2012, baby.\nI'm...\nYeah, of course. - Done deal.\nEasy. - Of course.\nQuick question.\nRussell's such a visionary, would it be okay if I took him through my Idea Notebook?\nNope, not at all. - Maybe I won't take him through the whole notebook...\nOr how about none of it?\nBut I have one that I'm really excited about called Real Apps, that I know Russell would be interested in.\nNo.\nNick, Real Apps is my idea.\nReal Apps is not your idea.\nSCHMIDT: Yeah, sure, you might have birthed the idea, but I midwifed it, and I midwifed the crap out of it.\nGuys.\nIt was a messy birth.\nNICK: You just thought of the name!\nThe name is everything.\nThe name is the name of the game.\nThe game is... is the name. The game is the name.\nThe product is the game.\nGuys!\nI know you can do this.\nYou sure you don't want to swing?\nNah. Pushing's where the action is.\n(chuckles)\nElvin, listen, buddy. I think we should talk.\nYou know I'm not going to be here forever, right?\nI know about death, Winston.\nI know there's no farm where dogs and grandpas go.\nWhat? No. It's just that I'm an adult.\nIt's time for me to get an adult job with adult people.\nYou understand, right?\nMaybe we should get to work on your resume because yours is terrible.\nIt's 2012, Winston.\nTyping is not a special skill.\nAnd you're familiar with the show?\nYes, I am. I've been listening for years.\nWhat do you think of Mr. Napoli?\nHe's actually like an idol of mine.\nBe honest, jackass!\nWould you consider yourself an undercover cop? - Huh?\nSeriously. Are you a cop? You have to tell me. - No!\nHow far can you drag an unconscious man?\nI don't know. I never really tried to... Hello, Mr. Napoli.\nIf you're as bad an assistant as you were a point guard, I'll eat you.\nYou know, I know you, Winston Bishop, okay?\nSub-par collegiate career, went to Latvia,\n9% from the European-slash-\nWomen's 3-point line?\nOkay, just...\nNow you wind up in my lap.\nWell, I'm the luckiest girl in school.\nHey, come on in, big guy. I want you to meet our new assistant, Winston Bishop.\nHey, first of all, I've not agreed to do it...\nWelcome to the team, Winston.\nHope Joe hasn't been too tough on you.\nI'm in. I'll do it.\nUm...\nSo nice to meet you, Mr. Kareem Abdul Jabbar.\nCan I sit on your shoulders?\nSure!\nReally?\nNo.\nOh.\nYou've made a wonderful decision.\nI'm sure you're going to learn a lot.\nKareem Abdul Jabbar.\nNAPOLI: Yeah, well, welcome aboard. You can start today.\nI want to Kareem about a segment on his show.\nI want to talk to you about the jackets.\n_\nYou said we were going to get show jackets!\nRussell, hey.\nI could show you around. I could show you our world.\nWay up here, it's crystal-clear.\nNick, you're doing Aladdin.\nAgain?\nDo you like cheeses, Russell?\nWhat? That's...\nNick, come on.\nIt's for Russell.\nSo you really just call these \"ethnic noodles\"?\nNo, actually, I don't know.\nThe only English writing on the box is,\n\"Find water. Grow hot. Family celebrate plus.\"\nThat guy.\nNick, stop staring.\nI'm not... what?\nSchmidt's being really weird, too.\nSo I told you and Jess to go get some sushi at Asakune, but I hear you hara-kiri'd that one.\nWell, I know the chef at Namuda.\nOh, oh. Namuda?\nMaybe \"My First Sushi.\"\nBaby wants a tempura California roll.\nLittle Russell wants...\nLittle Wussell wants an avocwado roll!\nJESS: Schmidt...! Nick, don't eat his noodles.\nYeah, but we're bowl brothers, now.\nNo, you're not.\nTighten up, guys. WINSTON: I'm gonna kill him.\nI'm gonna punch him in his rich, old white dude face.\nNot you.\nJoe Napoli.\nSo I guess you didn't get the job?\nNo, I got the job. And that's the problem.\nI want six shakes in my fridge at all times, ready to go.\nAnd I want it Beyonc\u00e9-colored.\nNot darker, not lighter.\nBeyonc\u00e9!\nClean your damn desk!\n(whispering):\nDon't let him see you cry.\nSee, I want to kill him.\nRuss, I was wondering if later, if you had a minute, if you wouldn't mind taking a look at my Idea Notebook.\nUm... Hold that thought.\nI will hold it.\nHold that thought 'cause he doesn't want to hear it, Nick.\nThose ideas were 51% mine.\n(garbage disposal rumbles, whines)\nI got it, I got it! Russell, move, my man.\nWhat'd I do?\nNo, you did nothing, my man. Don't blame yourself.\nYah! It just fights back a little bit, Russ.\n(clattering)\nAnchor me! Anchor me!\nIt's choking me! Come on. Go, go, go!\nCome on!\n(grunting)\nAnchor me. Don't grope me.\nJess, get in there!\nJess!\nNICK:\nOne more big one!\n(groans)\n(garbage disposal stops)\nOh, my God. Sorry.\nRUSSELL:\nYou guys, my contractor knows a really great plumber. - Please.\nI know the best plumbers in the business.\nWhite guy knows a plumber.\nSorry. Plumbing's, like, a really sensitive topic around here.\nI-I didn't know.\nI mean, who would?\n(chuckles)\nUm...\nhey...\nwho wants to play True American?\nI'm in.\nThat sounds like a great idea.\nJESS:\nSo it's 50%\ndrinking game,\n50% life-size Candyland.\nWell, it's more like 75 drinking,\n20 Candyland, and by the way, the floor is molten lava.\nIt's actually 90% drinking, and it's got a loose Candyland-like structure to it.\nJESS: Well, with steaks.\nHey, guys, we doing teams?\nYeah.\nReady?\nOne, two, three, go.\nSCHMIDT: Two, two, four. WINSTON: Wow, I'm with Russell. Perfect.\nWhat? You don't want to be on my team?\nWell, I just copied you.\nYou haven't given me any information yet.\nOh, okay.\n\n\n\nSo it starts off there are four zones. An alternate zone is a crazy zone.\nAnd there's a trail of chairs.\nBut the floor is lava.\nThese are the pawns. They're the soldiers of the secret order.\nThis is the king of the castle.\nAnd remember, everything you hear in True American is a lie, knock on wood.\nAnd it starts with a shotgun tip-off, okay?\nOh, that I can do.\nShotgun, for sure.\nOh, yeah!\nAll right! Yeah!\n(laughing)\nYeah! Yes!\nYeah, there's no going back now.\nOne, two, three, four, JFK!\nFDR! Up, up, up! FDR!\n(shouting)\nRussell, you're in the lava, man.\nI don't understand. Abe Lincoln, George Washington.\nOTHERS:\nCherry tree!\n(person whistles)\nAll right, Americans, you ready? Let's do the count.\nALL:\nOne, two, three.\nThat's me!\n(others cheering)\nOkay, remember:\nThe ground is lava.\nOTHERS (chanting):\nRussell! Russell!\nDon't touch the lava. (cheering)\n(laughs) NICK: Big R!\nJESS:\nOnly thing we have to fear ALL:\nIs fear itself!\nDrink!\nDrink!\n(shouts unintelligibly)\n(others shout unintelligibly)\n(laughing)\nJimmy Carter... atop...\nGrover Cleveland.\nWhat now?\nMore beer.\nMore beer.\nI got to get to the castle!\nGo, Nick, go! Russell, you're kind of ripped up, huh?\nWell, I used to work summers in a lumber camp near Banff, and I still split my own wood.\nJFK! FDR!\nYou're pretty good at this, old-timer.\nOoh, ooh, Cece, this is the best game of True American ever.\nI'm this close to winning.\nI'm gonna go get in your bed.\nDamn.\nYeah, I'm out.\nSchmidt, no!\nNo!\nDoes it mean we win?\nYes, we win!\nWhoo! (laughs)\n(cheering)\nBOTH:\nUSA! USA!\nOh, a little bit. Ah!\nUSA! USA!\nRUSSELL:\nI'm trashed.\nI'm in a trash bag right now.\nIt's true.\nI think we should call it a night.\nNo, no, hang on.\nI was, I was saying something.\nWhat you was saying to me. I remember.\nHey, guys, guys? I'm really sorry.\nI'm on a water break.\nIt's over here.\nOh, man, you were giving me advice on my boss because you are also a rich white man. And that's okay.\nHell, yeah, I am!\n(laughing)\nHey, I love ya.\n. Russell, we have a big day planned tomorrow, so maybe we should...\nShh-shh, hang on a sec.\nLet me straighten you out.\nHere's what you do.\nYour boss is power-playing you.\nSo you need to power-play him back.\nYes.\nHow do I do that?\nDip your boys in his shake.\nWhat?!\nThat's all you gotta do.\nYour testicles, dip 'em in, wring em out, dip it again and give him his shake. That's how you do it.\nThat's a terrible idea.\nJess, no, no. Shh.\nHang on. It's like a guy thing.\nTerritory. Jess, you don't know.\nIt's a guy thing, you know?\nJess doesn't get it. It's a territory...\nStop copying Russell.\nI'm not copying him. I love him.\nClassic is a classic, you know what I mean?\nJust get in there, dunk your nuggets in his shake!\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nWell, we all learned a lot.\nYou know what would make this night really great?\nIdea Notebook.\nSleep.\nYeah?\nHave you ever wanted to take a ride on a magic idea?\nWell, strap on, Russell.\nRussell, let's go to sleep.\nI'll be in in a second.\nI want to hear your idea.\nTake one more of these, and then this idea's gonna be even better.\nOkay.\nDown the hatch!\n(all groan)\nLet's have a little bit more of that.\nI'm mad at him, and I've never been mad at him before.\nOh, Jess!\nThis room is not a place of comforting, okay?\nThis is Darwin's jungle, where open-minded people do weird things to each other.\nGo away.\nYeah.\nI can't fight with him.\nThat's our thing. We don't fight.\nHe used to fight all the time with his ex-wife.\nI think he likes that we're peaceful.\nFighting's good. It's healthy.\nIt's how you know it's working.\nYou know, Jess, what Cece and I like to do is we like to fight with our bodies.\nIt's like very intense game of Capture the Flag.\nI won't make you guess what the flag is.\nAs my financial business partner, I appreciate you taking the time.\nAll right, Russell said we need a prototype.\nSo, Mr. Schmidt, I now present you \"Real Apps.\"\nThe phone obviously goes back here where the phone goes, and then these are all the apps.\nYou've got a Zippo. You've got a fork.\nYou've got a spoon.\nThat's a corn holder.\nIt's also a gentleman's shiv.\nNick, it's a prototype of a prototype at best.\nLet me see it.\nNo.\nDon't be mean about it.\nCome on, let me see it.\nYou got a bottle opener. - Come on.\nYeah. - Look at this.\nThere's no brushed steel, no nickel.\nI mean, it's got none of the baller metals.\nI mean, come on, man.\nI'm not gonna get Winkelvossed because of your sloppiness.\nWhat do you mean, \"I\"? Real Apps is my idea.\nYou just came up with the name!\nYeah, and the name is the game, friendo.\nMm-mm.\nYes, it is, man.\nNo, it isn't. No, it isn't, man.\nWould you line up around the corner if they called the iPhone a \"slippery germ brick\"?\nYeah, actually, I might.\nThat's why they call it basketball and not \"peach basket catch-it-up.\"\nYou just came up with that?\nHey, hey, we're back here on\nthe Joe Napoli Show, and let me\nintroduce you to a new member of the Joe Napoli Show family, and that is Winston Bishop, who is our new assistant.\nI'll tell you what ... he's sharp as a tack.\nLadies, there's no ring on his finger, and, Winston, why don't you tell us just a little bit about yourself?\n(goofy voice):\nHey, thanks, a lot, Joe.\nI really want to tell you about myself.\nYou know, I been on the job two days, and I don't know how to make no milk shake.\nOh, and I played two years of mediocre Division I basketball. - Wow.\nAnd why was that?\nWell, because I really didn't know how to play basketball.\nI got recruited for a girls' volleyball team.\nAll right, there he is. That's Winston Bishop.\nAnd we'll see you again probably never.\nAll right, turning now to the NBA picture, it looks like the West...\nThese are hangover eggs.\nSee, they'll either stop you from throwing up the rest of the day or you'll just throw it up really fast.\nIt's high-risk, high-reward.\nOh, maybe I should just go back to bed.\nI have a really nice day planned for us.\nWe're gonna go apple picking...\nI don't... I don't pick apples.\nThat... that's... that's not gonna happen.\nAre you serious?\nBecause it's picking and it's apple...\nYou're serious?\nThat literally sounds like hell.\nOkay.\nAre we in a fight?\nWe're not fighting.\nThis feels like a fight, Jess.\nThis is not a fight!\nRussell, my man, it seems these days there's an app for everything.\nDoesn't it, though?\nYeah, but there isn't.\nLet's say I'm out and about, you know, being mobile, and I want to cut a bagel, cobble a shoe.\nHaberdash on the fly.\nIs there an app for that?\nNo. Is there?\nUntil now.\nRight.\nWe now present to you...\nReal Apps! Real Apps!\nThe prototype.\nHmm, hmm, hmm.\nRelapse?\nReal Apps.\nReal Apps.\nRelapse?\nRelapse?!\nWould you calm...?\nYou called my baby\n\"relapse\"?!\nNo, I didn't call it anything. Just calm down!\nI gave you 51% of this for Relapse?\nRussell. Russell. Enough.\nRussell...\nHold it in your hands, my man.\nWe're in the middle of something, guys. JESS: No, no, no.\nWe're great. We're fine. Show it to him, Schmidt. SCHMIDT: It's all right here.\nLet me show it to you. NICK: Yeah, but you have to...\nI want to... Russell.\nYou're going the wrong way.\nAah! Oh! Oh, oh, no!\nOh, my God, Russell, are you okay? NICK: No, no, no.\nI've been stabbed!\nIt wasn't ready.\nIt wasn't ready.\nYou called it Relapse, idiot!\nWhere are the Band-Aids?\nNo Band-Aids! JESS: What?!\nOw! (panting)\nI'll get you a takeout napkin with some Scotch tape.\nSearing pain!\nSo sorry.\nHere. Oh, sorry.\n(groans) Ow! Ow! Jess.\nJess, do you know what? You just taped a napkin to my hand.\nYou know what? I'm gonna go.\nI need to be home right now.\nIs that a problem?\nNo.\nI'm fine.\nIt's great.\nWe're great.\nYeah.\n(mumbles)\nI'm s...\nJust nicked him.\n(door closes)\n(yells)\nGet it all out.\nI have an idea for your Idea book!\nReplace the Band-Aids!\nVery fair.\nIt's so sticky!\nOh, I have an app for that.\nELVIN:\nWhat are you doing here?\nWhy aren't you at your new job?\nI'm quitting.\nYou're quitting your dream job?\nWell, I mean, there's good news.\nI want to keep being your nanny.\nThat's what I've come to tell your mom.\nI can't let you do that.\nMom? Mom?\nWinston just asked me if he can smoke weed.\nWhat?!\nWhat?!\nNo, see...\nHe said when we go to the park, he wanted to do it.\nAnd I get to hold it because I'm a minor.\nWhere is your imagination taking you? No!\nYou said that in front of my kid?!\nGina...\nAre you serious?!\nAre you completely insane?!\nGina, you know me, okay?\nI'm wearing a tie and everything.\nYou're never, ever gonna nanny again.\nI will destroy you on the nanny boards.\nYou can count on that. Come on, Elvin. Just...\nLet me explain. Let me... Elvin, Elvin, Elvin, hey, now.\nElvin, let's get away. Get away from the hippie.\nCome on.\nBye, Winston.\nBye, Elvin.\nGINA: No, no, don't talk to him.\nIt's 4:20. Don't you have to be somewhere?\nOh, no.\nThe shakes.\nSix... Where are you, number six?\nNAPOLI: Hey, Bishop, I thought you left early.\nAssumed you weren't coming back.\nThere was something wrong with the shakes, so I went in and just threw them out because there's something wrong with 'em.\nSpeaking of which, I should probably go ahead and throw that one out. What did you do to the shakes?\nThey've been compromised.\nWhat... did... you... do?\nLook, I really, really want this job, Mr. Napoli, and I know you're going to fire me if I tell you what I did, but I would love a future here, and I don't want that to be jeopardized by a moment of... poor judgment.\nI put my beans in your shakes.\nYeah, and I...\nI shook it around a little bit like this.\nIn there? You stuck 'em down in there, huh?\nI did.\n(laughing)\n(laughing)\nOh, man!\n(laughing)\n(laughs weakly)\nYou know what we're gonna do?\nWe're gonna do that to Kareem.\n(chuckles)\nHi.\nHi.\nI have something to say to you.\nYou don't have to apologize.\nWell, I'm not here to apologize.\nI'm here to fight with you, and I don't care if you want to fight or not.\nAll right, let's fight.\nWell, I was prepared to have a perfectly nice weekend with you, and you just give up, and you come home.\nBecause I was bleeding from my hand. I had to go to the ER.\nI had to get a stitch.\nOoh, stitches.\nI'm too fancy for a Band-Aid.\nI'm actually... I'm actually really sorry about that.\nJess, I haven't played a drinking game in ten years.\nThe only reason I did is\n'cause you asked me to.\nIf I want to have a drink, I don't really have to play a game while I'm doing it.\nWell, that's my world. Garbage disposals don't work.\nElevators don't pass inspection.\nWait. I didn't know about the elevator.\nYeah, it was, like, the cables were really thin. We signed a waiver.\nThey took 100 bucks off our rent.\nThat's really not safe!\nWell, that's where I live, and those are my friends.\nAnd that wasn't even the first stabbing this month.\nAnd Russell, my life is just as important as your life.\nAnd if you want to get with me, you're gonna have to get with my friends, and that is a Spice Girls song.\n(chuckling)\n(laughing)\nWe just had a fight.\nI won.\nYou did not win.\nHey, tell you what. Let's just go back to your loft and try again.\nLet's just hang out.\nOh. Now?\nI mean... I just got here.\nMaybe later.\n(laughs)\nOkay, that sounds like a plan.\nThose boxers you borrowed ... I'm gonna need them back.\nThey're my lucky underpants.\nLucky underpants?\nAnd what are the values of the Olympic games?\nOpenness, exchange.\nThe first victims of an authoritarian security regime.\nI'm Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and that's The View from Up Here.\n"}, {"title": "01x21 - Kids.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nBut you're using birth control, right?\nYeah, of course.\nIt's just that Schmidt gets so athletic that birth control becomes like one of those plastic barbecue covers in a hurricane.\nI didn't want to know that.\nOkay, the pregnancy test doesn't work until after six days, so just get through the weekend and don't tell Schmidt until you're sure.\nYeah, no, of course not, of course.\nIt's just...\nI can't stop thinking about what a Schmidt baby would be like.\nJust, I mean, I, I don't know.\nWould it just want to nurse 24 hours a day?\nProbably.\nWe could make it, like, a douche baby jar.\n(chuckles)\n(gasps)\nOh, my God.\nSCHMIDT:\nLadies, ladies, what is all the screaming about?\nOh, my... Jess, have you finally agreed to be our third?\nBecause, you know, we've discussed this.\nWe have never talked about that, Schmidt.\nWhat? Schmidt, this is not the time.\nSchmidt, we were just thinking about what you might have been like as a baby.\nOh, I was the bomb diggity as a baby.\nI mean, I was, I was, like, break-dancing at eight months old.\nBut they say that I needed a magnum size diaper.\nOh, my God.\nGet out. Seriously?\n Who's that girl? \n Who's that girl? \n Who's that girl? \n Who's that girl?   It's Jess. \nAll right, what's with the suit?\nAnd if you say swing dancing, I'm gonna slap your face.\nWell, my boss is going to be on TV today...\nMichael Strahan's new talk show On the Strahan Narrow.\nGreat show.\nHe's got too many DUls to drive himself, so I guess I got to take him.\nJESS:\nSit in my room, Schmidt.\nCece's resting.\nHey, guys, um, listen up.\nUh, Sarah is going to be here in a few minutes, so best behavior.\nWho's Sarah? Russell's daughter, so no F-bombs, P-bombs.\nActually, no \"B\" through \"S\"\nbombs, no bombs, and no bringing home college girls, Berlusconi.\n(chuckles) Hey, that's not fair.\nThe girl I've been hanging out with is totally mature and interesting.\nPlease put on some pants.\nEverything you say sounds really creepy when you're not wearing pants.\nYour hair looks nice.\nBOTH: Ugh.\nMmm, this coffee is smoldering.\nSo creepy.\nSo what's with the babysitting?\nI think he's actually testing me.\nI think he's seeing if I can be a mom.\nAre you nervous?\nIt's nothing I can't handle.\nI'm halfway there... I'm already her teacher, so...\n(phone chirps)\nOh, she's here.\nUm, Nick, uh, put on some pants or at least some really high socks.\nHigh socks it is.\nHi, Ms. Day.\nHi, Sarah.\nI can be here in under five minutes if I need to be.\n(sighs)\nHonestly I wouldn't have agreed to this, except my husband is out of town, and you're Sarah's favorite teacher and my husband's favorite teacher.\n(chuckles)\nUm, hey, um, I hope this doesn't sound rude, but, um, you keep saying\n\"husband\"\nand I just want to make sure you and Russell...\nyou're not still married?\n(laughing):\nOh... no, no.\n(both laughing)\n'Cause I just, like, wanted to make sure there wasn't some very important piece of information that I totally missed.\nNo, I mean, but he'll always be my husband, if you know what I mean.\nYeah.\nActually, could you explain what you mean very clearly?\nCece's acting really weird.\nDo you think she's getting tired of me?\nI mean, look, it's been, like, months of non-stop sex.\nI mean, what can I do if she doesn't let me hit the fifth chakra?\nI'm not listening to you.\nI'm just, I'm just saying, look, do you think she wants something more than sex? (phone ringing)\nDo you think she's finally becoming a girl?\n'Cause I can't handle that, man.\nHey, boss. What are you doing?\nHmm?\nLook...\nW-W-Wait, n-n-no, yesterday you said noon, but it's only 10:30.\nDo you think that I've become too dependent on a hot lava massage?\nHmm?\nI'm gonna be there in just a second.\nWhat about costumes?\nI got to go, bye.\nDo you think I made her dress up too much?\nLook, man, I'm not going to sit here and bond with you about this, all right?\nI got to go babysit my boss.\nJESS: Hey, Schmidt, you gonna stay for dinner?\nWe're going to borrow your pasta maker.\nOh, that's great, are you gonna teach Sarah your recipe for overcooked mush?\nJESS: Ha, ha, no, I'm teaching her about Italy.\nNICK: I'm coming with a date...\nChloe. Uh, no, you're not.\nYou are not bringing any of those girls around Sarah.\nHey, you must be Sarah.\nAnd you guys are wrong about Chloe. Okay, Chloe is smart and she's mature and she knows about art and famous artists like Banksy and the guy who did the Obama poster and, you know, like, Chalk Outline Guy.\nThat's stupid.\nYour eyes are so brown.\nThey look like poop.\nBe honest with me... do my eyes look like poo?\nThere's a bit of a, a poopy-ish hue.\nOld poo eyes.\n(Sarah laughs)\n(sighs)\nOh, hey.\nI like your house.\nIt's not my house!\nGo, go!\nWhat?\n(speaking Cambodian)\nGo!\n(tires screeching)\n(yelling in Cambodian)\nWhat's going on?\nWhat are you talking about, man?\nI'm sweating spicy ban hoaw, wearing a Cambodian woman's shoes.\nWhat do you think is going on? I don't know, I'm just trying to give you an opportunity to lie to me, Joe, just trying to be polite.\nActually, the ancient Egyptians made pasta by flattening the dough with their feet.\nCool, huh?\nSarah?\nHey.\n(chuckles)\nWhy do you have so many bras?\nYou're a teacher.\nTeachers need bras, too.\nYou know, like, all that erasing and stuff.\nIt's like...\nThat's an after-\nschool bra.\nCan I get out of doing homework because you're dating my dad?\nNo.\nUm, hey, I know having your teacher dating your dad is weird, um, but I just want you to know that, um, you can ask me anything.\nReally?\nYeah, anything.\nAre you in love with my dad?\nHmm... oh...\nDo you and my dad ever dry-lump?\nG... uh...\nIs sexting cool?\nWhat? No, it's not cool.\nHave you done a 99?\nI think that's a tax form.\nHave you ever given anyone plow jobs?\nI don't know.\nHow do you make love to a person animal-style?\nDo you want to learn how to play bridge?\nSCHMIDT:\nI've been doing some thinking, and\nI think it's time that I take you on a real date.\nYou're asking me out on a date?\nYeah, it'll be our first real date.\nNow, Italy on Ice is a celebration of all things Italian featuring ice dancing's biggest and brightest Italian stars.\nDrea de Matteo is scheduled to appear, but, you know, they're not liable if she doesn't.\nI can't go right now.\nIt's a really bad time, okay?\nI'm sorry, just take someone else.\nYou mean, like another girl?\nYeah, Schmidt, that's what this is.\nThat's the deal.\nJust take someone else, okay?\nAll right, yeah, sure, yeah, I'll just...\nI'll ask somebody else, I'll just... yeah, totally, and with these VIP tickets I got... poppacorno.\nWhat?\nPoppacorno.\nPoppacorno.\nIt's \"popcorn\"\nin Italian.\nI don't think you should be rushing into these things.\nYou need to look for a partner who is...\nEw, you said \"partner.\"\nI know, that sucked.\nI'm sorry.\nLook, as your friend Jess, not Ms. Day, just choose someone who makes you laugh.\nLike Nick?\nYeah, I mean... wait, what?\nOh, my God, oh, my God, I love Nick so, so, so much.\nHe's so hot.\nThat Nick?\nI want to rub my face on his face.\n(moans)\nJust to be clear, I am dialing another woman to go see Italy on Ice right now.\nCECE:\nThat's fine, do it.\nHey, guys, not now.\nOh, it's ringing.\nDon't care.\nThis room cannot take any more hormones.\nI love the juxtaposition of high-brow literary with low-brow youth culture.\nIt's almost too much juxtaposition for me.\nYou know what I mean?\nIt's, like, right up to the line of juxtaposition, but I think I'm gonna let it slide.\n(ringtone playing)\nHey, I got to... yes.\nYou've got Nick.\nHey, Nick-ole.\nWhat it be, girl?\nWhat's going on, Schmidt?\nWhat you got going on, ma?\nIt's the freakin' weekend.\nDid you just call me \"girl\"?\nAre you wearing something sexy?\nJust, you know, button-down and jeans like always.\nOh, you got jeans on, baby, are they tight?\nHmm, they're a little loose;\nI buy 'em big.\nOh, them jeans sound sexy.\nEverything all right?

I love Nick so, so, so much.\nHe's so hot, I'm going to die.\nSarah, Nick is way too old for you.\nI live with him.\nHe is dirty and weird.\nNo, no, no, no...\nSarah, not Nick's room.\nIt's not well ventilated in there.\nLet's see, we'll get there a little early, maybe get you in the shower, maybe a once-over with some disinfectant.\nHmm... hey.\nYard sale... pull over.\n(chuckles)\nNo.\nSomeone rich died, I can smell it.\nOkay, look, Joe, I'm trying to get you to the show on time.\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?\nI'll push you out of the car, okay?

I don't know how this happened.\nThink she did it on purpose?\nAn Indian-Jewish baby... who wouldn't want that? Think about the bone structure.\nOkay, I'm not ready to be a godparent.\nDon't ask.\nNo one's asking you.\nPhew, good.\nI'm not into being an uncle.\nYou're not my brother!\n\n\n\nOkay, Schmidt, are you sure you're okay about this?\n'Cause I'm freaking out by the fact that you're not freaking out!\nYeah, I'm oddly calm about the whole thing.\nLook, Nick, maybe this isn't exactly in my five-year plan, but maybe this is fate.\nYou know, maybe I hit the jackpot.\nMaybe this is the universe telling me that I'm never gonna find a girl better than Cece.\nBy, the way, I'm-I'm Schmidt.\nChloe. Mazel tov on your news.\nOh, my God, finally, Nicholas.\nYou bring home a nice girl.\nRight?\nSo... that was crazy what happened with my friends, right?\nI liked it.\nYour life's like\nGossip Girl,\nonly everyone is old and poor.\nYou know, there actually was a show like that.\nIt was called Golden Girls.\nI'm Betty White, Schmidt's Rue McClanahan...\nDon't you think Nick is hot?\nNick? Um... yeah, in a rumpled, small-town P.I. kind of way.\nWhat's he like in the morning?\nDo his eyes get sleepy?\nDoes he love stuff?\nI want to love what he loves.\nDo you think that we'll ever do animal style?\nFour minutes! We eat in four!\nI made you a mocktail.\nCece, are you crying?\nNo. No. (sniffles)\nNo. I-I... I just... I don't... I don't know.\nYou're an amazing woman, and you're going to do and be so many things in this life.\nMaybe you'll be a mom, and maybe... maybe not.\nBut I will support you no matter what.\nThank you.\nI also just want to give you a quick heads up.\nI'm probably going to be going on the internet before we have sex again, because I-I just... I don't want to impregnate the baby, you know?\nI mean, we could have a Russian nesting doll situation on our hands.\n(loud munching, fork scrapes plate)\nSo, Sarah and I learned to use the pasta maker today, which was cool.\nAre you and Nick making love?\nHmm?\nWho wants seconds? That's my question.\nYeah, I would love seconds, Jess. That'd be great.\nIf you're a boy, I'm gonna...\nI'm gonna name you Mordecai, or Abraham, Menachem Menandel, Schmerson.\nHey! I'm watching you.\nWell, time for dessert.\nNo, please don't get up. I will take care of it.\nOh, thank you. That's so thoughtful.\nSee? Thoughtful and mature.\nIn your face! Yes!\nCongratulations. You're dating a girl with basic table manners.\nYou win. Why don't you get on her health care plan?\n(blowing raspberries)\nSCHMIDT:\nI'm so excited to take this journey with you.\nI mean, your boobs are gonna be unbelievably enormous.\nJESS:\nSarah, do you want to go help Chloe with the dessert? I hate her.\nOh, come on, you don't hate her.\nYou don't know her well enough to hate her.\nYes, I do! I know her.\nShe used to ride on my school bus.\nNo, no, no, that's...\nWhat?\nOh, my God, that's why you look so familiar!\nYou were that crazy little kindergartner who had, like, the imaginary friends.\nOh.\nYou're the skank with the skank face.\nSarah, I know you're trying to look cool in front of you you know who...\nWhat?! You told him?!\nNo! I did not tell him.\nYou just told him!\nOh, my God, Jess!\n(door slams, Jess sighs)\nWhat are you saying?\nWhen was the last time you were on a school bus?\nLast year.\nHow old are you?\n18.\n(groaning)\nJESS:\nHey, you know what, Chloe?\nI actually think I subbed for your eighth grade English class.\nThat's right! Hi, Miss Day!\nHi.\n(Nick groans)\nWell, it's a good thing I got you an extra shirt, 'cause...\n(grunts)\nWhoa! Joe, Joe!\nWhere you going? Where you going? Wait.\nWhere are you going? Uh, sorry about this, man.\nHey, don't make me chase you! Do not make me chase you!\nJoe, come back.\n(coughs)\n(thudding)\n(grunts)\nOh! Are you okay?\nLeave me alone.\nSo, come on, man. What's up?\nMichael Strahan makes me feel like an idiot.\nOkay? I mean, he thinks he's better than me.\nHe wins the Super Bowl, and suddenly, he's the best at everything.\nWhat's he better than you at? Huh?\nMarriage, probably. Money management, I would say.\nProbably he's better than you at that.\nWell...\nHe's not better than you at yard sales.\nHe's good at yard sales.\nYeah, but he's not better than you.\nSo here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna walk into that studio, and you're gonna show him the Napoli that I saw today.\nThe one that I saw grabbed seven copies of Speed on VHS at a yard sale for a fraction of the retail price.\nWhen's the last time Strahan did that?\nBoom. You're not gonna let him win.\nYeah. You know, I'm gonna do it.\nI'm gonna do it.\nYou're gonna do it?\nThat guy's a b-hole. He's a b-hole!\nYou know what? If you were a woman, or even dressed as a woman, man, we'd be unstoppable.\nMm, mm.\n18 years old. She was 18 years old.\nShe doesn't even know what Netscape is.\nThinks of Ice Cube as mainly an actor.\nThis is a disaster! Ouli's downstairs.\nShe just called me. She wants to be let up.\nSarah's in my room, because she fell in love with you for some unknown reason.\nI might as well call you\nBridge to Terabithia,\nbecause you make children cry.\nAnd you... I might as well call you\nIndian In the Cupboard because you put an Indian in Ce... Never mind.\nI will not apologize for my powerful sperm.\nWhy are young girls in love with me? I look like an old man.\nShut up, both of you!\nWe're gonna fix this, 'cause I'm not losing Russell because you two have to make and/or date babies.\nYou... go stall Ouli.\nTry not to get her pregnant.\nYou... come with me and get Sarah out of my room.

No, I never will.\nI can be a bit of an anchor.\nI've been known to drag women down.\nThat is true.\n(whispers): Save me.\nWhat? This is so entertaining.\nOkay, Jess, honestly, help me.\nI don't know what to do. All right.\nOkay, just tell her something about life or something.\nHey, Sarah?\nSarah, I haven't loved somebody the way you love me in a very long time, and I miss that feeling.\nThe feeling you have is good. It's just misplaced.\nIt's better than being numb your whole life.\nYou end up doing such weird things.\nYou know what? Just stay in there.\nIt's not that great out here.\nStay in there as long as you can.\nHe's kidding, Sarah.\nYou should definitely, definitely come out.\nOh, my God.

All the stuff you said about Caroline, being about timing, and it just making sense?\nNo.\nBecause if you really love someone, it's simple.\nOkay. Well, I understand what you're saying, but...\nYou deserve something amazing.\nAnd... you deserve love.\nI know you don't want to be alone, but I'm going to be there, and I'll tell that Tom Waits voice in your head to shut up.\n(Tom Waits voice):\nWe don't have to settle...\nNick.\nYou're the best.\nI'm moving in with Caroline.\nWe signed a lease this morning.\nThanks for saying all that stuff.\nNow that I got your attention, Future Nick, there's a few things I'd like to talk to you about.\nBe nicer to your mom when she calls.\nStop giving yourself high fives.\nPut your head underwater, you two-year-old.\nBe nicer to Coach, or he's gonna take off, live with a bunch of other white people.\n(bad accent):\nI no fake karate.\nI'm Nick, I'm grumpy.\nI'm going to put my baby hood on.\nsex is a sprint, not a marathon.\n You are special, you are special \n You... \nWe'll see each other in the future...\nunless I see you first.

Why are you saying that?\nWill you go to Ikea with me?\nSure, I'm not doing anything.\nBut don't let me lay my eyes on the Malm collection.\nI can't afford it, and I'm a sucker for it every time.\nI'll go get my golf pencils.\nMm-hmm.\nIf you got something to say, my man, just say it.\nHey, look, a man can only sit back and observe but for so long before he has to speak his mind.\nThen speak your mind.\nA line has been crossed, all right?\nYou, my friend, have become her fluffer.\nLike in p0rn?\nAn emotional fluffer.\nI'm an emotional fluffer?\nYou got to set some boundaries, all right?\nYou're gonna start fulfilling ever single need of hers, all right?\nDoing all the things that a boyfriend would do...\nWinston...for some other dude who ain't doing nothing.\nAnd I'm her friend.\nYou're her boyfriend.\nNo, I'm not her boyfriend.\nYou're a boyfriend without the rewards.\nHow about this? Why don't you just shut up?\nHey, Nick, you ready?\nYeah.\nSo it's not available at the closest Ikea, but it is available at the second-closest Ikea, which is about 45 minutes...\nif we could drive over the reservoir.\nBut we can't, so...\nit's about an hour and a half.\nCool.\nI had so much sex last night.\nFluffer.\nYou're gonna get caught.\nImpossible.\nI've been studying Romney trivia all day long.\nMemorizing Dad's gestures so I can mimic him.\nYou're calling Mitt Romney \"Dad\"\nnow? That's where we're at?\nMm-hmm.\nSchmidt, we get it.\nHe's the dad you never had.\nOkay, all-knowing Indian god Ganesha, this is about sex.\nYou know they have Romney Olympics every summer at the lake house?\nI bet that's a hoot. I'm sure it's like the real Olympics, only the white people win the sprints.\nOkay, so you good?\nOkay.\nYeah.\nHey, Nick, any chance you understand how to put this together?\nI think it looks pretty easy, actually.\nNo, you know, I'm actually busy. I'm, uh...\nI'm moving money around.\nI'm-I'm diversifying. I've got...\nAnd I'm not your fluffer, by the way.\nWhat's a fluffer?\nIn pornography, it's the person who keeps the actor...\nmotivated, aroused, you know?\nEw! That's a job?\nAnd that's what I am. I'm your emotional fluffer.\nI'm there whenever you need a guy.\nYou want a cup of tea, I'll make it.\nYou lose your phone, I'll call.\nYou're my friend. That's what friends do.\nI'm you boyfriend without the rewards.\nYeah.\nYou're saying you want the...?\nNo! No, no, no, no, no. Not with you. Blecch!\nDon't say \"blecch!\"\nI don't want it.\nI'm not disgusting. It's not an unheard of thought.\nBlecch!\nCome on. Admit it, you've thought about it.\nYou and me, sexually? Nope.\nBlecch! Never thought about it once.\nDon't lie.\nNot on purpose.\nSleeping Nick is a totally different guy.\nYou know you did when you walked in on me doing deep lunges.\nYeah, check my Google history, Jess.\nIt's filled with girls doing deep lunges.\nI mean, I'll admit I've thought about it.\nYeah.\nWhen was this?\nLast year. Just once.\nWould you like to eat me?\nWhat do you mean? Aren't you a little small?\nWhat, are you nuts?!\nWhat happened?\nWhy am I doing this?\nThat's what does it for you?\nYeah, I thought about it for five minutes, and then I realized it would never, ever work between us.\nYeah, I agree. That's how I see it.\nGreat. I'm glad we agree on something.\nMe, too!\nGreat.\nOut of curiosity, why do you think that, though?\nBecause you drive me nuts, Miller!\nBecause you're always sighing, like you're the president of the United States and you have to decide whether we're going to war or not.\nI sigh because you sing about everything.\nI do not.\n? And I hate it. ?\n? You sing and dance about nothing. ?\n\n\n\nYou're cheap!\nYou are so cheap.\nI'm not cheap.\nYou never, ever put money in any tip jar, ever.\nWhat are you talking about?\nI've never seen you ever do that.\nLast week, when we went to the coffee shop.\nYou put nickels in the tip jar!\nYou know what a jar is in my business?\nNickels! Nickels are worse than no money; it's an insult.\nIt's just a little boy saying, \"Love me!\"\n\"Give me attention!\"\nYou're a bartender.\nYou live on tips. You should know better.\nThe nickel?\nThe only American currency...\nYou can't not give someone a tip Because you don't like tip jars!\n...graced with the face of Thomas Jefferson.\nWell, I think that's rude, Nick!\nI didn't realize you were on the fence about the Louisiana Purchase...\nYou hate everything!\n...Jessica!\nAnd I could never live with that.\nI barely live with it now!\nBut you need me to have sex.\nThat's what you think?\nI'm calling Sam, and we're gonna go on a date.\nAnd we're gonna talk our faces off.\nOkay?\nGood luck. Good luck with that.\nCan't find your phone, Jess?\nNo, I'll find it.\n'Cause I'm not calling you this time.\nAre you happy now?\nNow I have to get to know the guy I'm sleeping with.\nThat was a pocket dial!\nThat was an ill-timed pocket dial!\nI will not explain myself!\nI just wish I had a lot more solo Tugg time.\nYou know?\nWell, you can be Tugg with me.\nSometimes I think that I'm just a riddle that, well, even I can't solve.\nYeah, see? I tried to solve it again.\nHi.\nHi.\nI hope it's okay, I invited over some of the Kappas For Romney.\nKappas For Romney!\nCourtney.\nSuch a pleasure. - Courtney.\nI'm April.\nApril.\nThey just got so excited when I said I met one of the Romney boys.\nNo, who wouldn't be?\nDid you ask him?\nI think April's in love with your brothers.\nWho isn't?\nWho's the shy one?\nWho's the joker? Who's tried coffee?\nApril, you're such a spaz.\nYeah, no, nobody gets rowdy like us Romney boys.\nJust a bunch of alphas, you know what I mean?\nYeah.\nThat is, of course, unless we're fishing on Lake Winnipesauke.\nThere's nothing that I love more than just getting out on the water with Dad, the freezing cold dawn, a couple of cold beers in hand.\nHaving that one quick moment...\nYour dad doesn't drink. He's a Mormon.\nWell, we don't drink the beers, Courtney.\nYou know, we just buy them to support American breweries.\nThen we dump them in the lake.\n'Cause we're Americans.\nSo... um...\nI want a casual sex affair, just like in the movies.\nNice.\nBut it turns out...\nI need some conversation first.\nSo...\nIf you want to hang...\nNo.\n...Hang out more...\nI don't...\nI don't want to hang out more.\nOkay.\nBecause, if I hang out with you, it's just the truth, I'm gonna fall in love with you.\nIt's just how I am. I can't separate things out.\nQuestion:\nUnder what circumstances would you build a dresser for a woman?\nAnd this is, like...\nand I'm not interested in sleeping with her?\nUm...\nAm I being blackmailed?\nNo.\nIs it like a...\nit's like a Make-A-Wish Foundation type thing?\nNo.\nI mean... Yeah. Marriage.\nYou know, anything besides marriage is a...\nyou know, an abuse.\nAn abuse?\nYeah, you can't do that to a friend.\nUnless your friend's a chump.\nOr a certified carpenter... that would work.\nWait a minute. This isn't a sex thing, is it?\nBecause I... you know, I can't pleasure a woman and build a dresser at the same time, you know?\nI'm not God.\nHey.\nHey!\nHey! Hey, hey, hey, what's going on, man?\nAre you going to the dark place?\nI'm not going to the dark place, okay?\nI did what you said, I told her I didn't want to be her fluffer, and it went great.\nThen what is wrong with you? Get up, man.\nLook, I did what you said, and I feel terrible.\nBecause you didn't set boundaries.\nI don't know what that means, Winston.\nAs a friend, you can lift a heavy object, but you can't drive her to the airport, okay?\nYou can hold the elevator, but only if you see her running down the hallway saying, \"Hey, man, please can you hold the elevator?\"\nNo picnics, no mini-muffins and never Adele.\nAdele?\nNever Adele.\nAdele's amazing.\nNo Adele.\nNo concerts, no music, no T-shirts, no nothing.\nBut guys and girls...\nNever Adele!\nA little Adele.\nHey. Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey!\nNick! You're gonna calm down, okay?\nYou want my help or what, man?\nYes.\nDon't be so intense.\nMost importantly...\nyou will not build her that dresser.\nIt's furniture.\nIt implies that one day, you will share it with her.\nAnd that's not gonna happen.\nYou're right. You're right.\nAre-are you spelling it right?\nTwo \"G\"s, silent \"B.\"\nHere's a picture of the whole family.\nAnd you are not in it.\nYeah, well, somebody had to take the picture, Megan.\nJust admit it. You're not a Romney.\nI'm not a Romney? Would a non-Romney know this?\nThat Ma and Pa never go to bed angry.\nThat there are 16 grandchildren, Allie, Joe, Thomas, Gracie, Wyatt, Parker, Miles, Jonathan, Sawyer, Nate, Nash, Mia, Owen, Soleil, Nick and Chloe.\nThose are just facts you got from the Internet.\nI'm proud to be a Romney.\nOkay? I'm proud to have had a dad that was around when I was growing up.\nA dad that took me camping, a dad that spent Saturdays with me, throwing... throwing the football.\nA dad that gave me a wink when I left for prom night and said, \"Be safe, son.\"\nWhen I think of a dad like that, I'm proud not only of the Romney name, but of this country.\nGod bless Mitt Romney.\nGod bless America.\nIt's a candid shot from the governor's biography.\nThe caption says,\n\"The whole family.\"\nNitpicking turns me off.\nYou're all horribly unattractive to me.\nTugg Romney, out.\nHey.\nI got your text.\nWhen you're going through a Taylor Swift-like range of emotions, I should come over, right?\nYou were the only one that I could talk to.\nBeing brown, you have the wisdom of 1,000 white women.\nAll right.\nWhat happened with that girl?\nWinston.\nWinston.\nHey.\nAre you serious right now?\nWell, I...\nHe-he said it was okay.\nShe is off limits.\nGo call your girlfriend.\nYou obviously have things you need to work out.\nFine.

All right?\nFind a way to forgive him for not being a presidential candidate with great hair.\nForget it.\nNo one understands.\nThere, I thought you needed that, okay?\nJust take a breath, and it will...\nShh.\nShh, shh, shh.\nIt's like memory foam.\nCall your dad.\nYou've been cheating on me in your mind?\nYes, but, like, to be fair, you were there.\nA lot of times, you would just pop up mad, but you were there.\nWinston, come on, it's fine.

I'll just show you.\nIt's sort of... Come in this way.\nNo, no, I see what you're doing. That asymmetry right there?\nThat's crucial.\n'Cause then what I'll do is is I'll go outside, get the paper, and shake the neighbor's hand.\nInteresting.\nThen what I'll do is, I'll tie a bow on it because it's birthday time.\nThen I get onstage and collect my Oscar and say thank you to the people, thank you to the people, then get back down offstage and get everybody into the sharing circle, right down there in the sharing circle, and then...\nspike the volleyball.\nThen what I like to do is, I like to arrive at the bridge, meet the troll, and then answer his riddles three.\nThen what we do is, we're dancing.\nWe're just gonna dance, we're gonna dance for a while.\nWe'll dance until you can't dance anymore, dancing till you can't dance anymore, and then everybody gets a churro.\nYou okay?\nMm-hmm.\nIt's the baby hormones.\nThey are not as gay as me.\nSo I'm good at this, right?\nSchmidt, in my professional opinion, you have definitely earned the rank of ...\nand I will use the phrase you coined ... va-genius.\nThank you, thank you so much.\nI really needed to hear that, Sadie.\nYou got to go.\nHey, Winston,\nwe're going on an adventure!\nWe need real-life experience like Hemingway.\nWhoo, I feel like Hemingway.\nThis is life experience?\nYeah, the zoo is the best we can do, I told you, but it's got everything we need.\nIt's got life, animals, man, beast.\nLook, I'm sorry, dude, it's just, you know, I'm not supposed to be awake right now because of my adjusted...\nAdjusted schedule, yeah.\nHey, man, 13\nminutes of sleep.\nHonestly, Nick, seriously,\n13 minutes of sleep ... that's all I got.\nYou're starting to look like a pillow to me.\nAll I can think of is, like,\n\"Man, Nick looks exactly like a pillow to me.\"\nHmm, what'd you say? Winston, you need some sleep.\nBut I'm out here with you.\nYeah.\nOkay, because I love you.\nThank you.\nAnd I want you to finish your zombie book.\nOkay, but check out where we are.\nThis is experience, this is what's firing me up to get back to writing.\nThis is kind of what it's all about.\nWhat are you doing?\nIt's writer's fuel.\nThat's what Hemingway said.\nSadie, um, hey.\nUh, I just, I just want you to know that I am, um, I'm like ...\nI am okay with whatever you tell me.\nI'm just like, if you say you've got a year, that's fine.\nIf you say, like, \"You can have kids till you're 80,\"\nthat's fine, too.

Is that true?\nYes, but no... it's out of context.\nIt's out of context, Nick.\nYou think you know everything about me.\nI'm a rock and roll guy.\nYou are the guy who asks me to light matches for you\n'cause you're afraid your fingers are gonna get too hot.\nI did that one time.\nMultiple times.\nI was on the back of a motorcycle earlier, and I wasn't even that scared.\nYou don't think I'm crazy?\nNo.\nWould a sane man do this?\nOh!\nOh!\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.\nYou're doing it.

I had no idea, I'm sorry.\nI know. We said it was open, but...\nI'm proud of you for saying that.\nDr. Sam?\nIf you were a hat, you'd be a top hat.\nBut like a really big Monopoly one.\nAnd I say that of the deepest compliments.\nAppreciate it.\nWinston, I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.\nWhat, help me realize that I'm black?\nSchmidt, believe it or not, man, I've known that for a while now.\nI just feel bad you're forced to live here with Jess and Nick.\nOh, wow.\nI mean, they're honky as hell.\nAnd look at our people.

It's about time I got a little responsibility.\nResponsibility?\nI thought of a new promotion ... it's like Ladies' Night but it's the opposite:\nIt's Guys' Night.\nThe new manager loved the idea, and if it goes well ...\nMaybe there's a promotion;\nI can start moving up in the world.\nWhat?\nI want him.\nI want him... bad.\n Who's that girl? \n Who's that girl? \n It's Jess. \nWhat is this?\nI think Nick being ambitious and driven about the bar is making me...\nwant him more. Is that, like, a thing?\nNo. No woman's ever been attracted to power and success.\nIt's just like...\nI thought it was one kiss and then it was over.\nHey, sorry, I'm just putting a load on.\nGot a shift at the bar.\nYou know that there's a separate compartment to put the soap in?\nI didn't know that.\nLittle soap house.\nAnyway, I'm getting this mess cleaned up.\nI gotta say, it feels really good.\nDo any of you guys know where the iron is?\nGet out!\nWhat? I want to iron my button-down.\nGet out, Nick!\nWhat is happening right now?\nGet out!\nWhy are you being so mean to me?\nGet out!\nWhat is going on with you?\nThere's a new manager; That's why I'm making you guys pay.\nAnd you actually care about what he thinks?\nHey, Shane.\nHey.\nHey, guys. This is Shane. This is my new manager.\nOh, got it.\nI'm really excited to have her here.\nWe're really getting this place in order. We're, uh...\nMakes a lot more sense now.\nGod, I can't stop thinking about the other night.\nHope you gave that bar an extra wipe-down.\nYeah.\nYou're just like the opposite of everyone I went to business school with.\nI mean, look at you. You're just... You're so real. - Yeah.\nOh, yeah.\nHe's incredibly real.\nAs real as they get.\nYeah, the realest.\nShut up, both of you.\nYou're a mess.\nYeah. - I got dirt on my face after we made out.\nGod, I loved it. Get back to work.\nYou got it.\nGet back to work!\nI'm joking. No, but seriously, Yeah. Joke. Seriously, get back to work. Yeah.\nGet back to work. Yeah.\nI know this isn't gonna end well, but the whole middle part's gonna be awesome.\nGood for you.\nWhat?\nSchmidt, stop drinking that.\nI'm gonna take care of this.\nIf I feel down, I come here.\nI love this place, man. You know, the sound of bubbles, soothing synth music.\nIf this place doesn't take your mind off of Cece, then I don't know, man.\nLook at that.\nSo beautiful.\nAnd exotic.\nPerfect curves.\nGiant almond eyes.\nCaramel-colored stripes.\nSumptuous lips.\nAre you talking about the fish?\nExcuse me. You, sir, that works here.\nWhat is this fish ... the one that floats like an angel?\nHow much for this one?\nAh, that is the lovely but elusive California lionfish.\nIt's perfect. I must have it.\nS-Sadly, sir, you can't.\nWhat do you mean I can't?\nIt's... illegal, sir.\nThis fish is protected by the great state of California.\nGimme it!\nNo...?\nWhat are you doing? Why can't I have the things that I want?\nSorry about that.\nDon't look at the fish, kids.\nYou can't have any of them!\nNone of them are for sale!\nLove is a lie. It is.\nCalm down!\nLove is a lie. Love is a lie.\nWe're leaving. We're leaving.\nOh, you've got to be kidding me.\nSchmidt, no. Absolutely not.\nNo! I don't trust fish.\nThey breathe water ... that's crazy.\nYeah, he's got a whole thing going.\nSchmidt ... an aquarium?!\nWhen did you become a Bond villain that couldn't afford not to live with roommates?\nThis is where I will keep my lionfish.\nYour lionfish?\nA rare beauty.\nThe result of generations of interracial fish breeding.\nJust undulating in that water with that wry smile.\nPerfect, round fish breasts.\nPull it together.\nWhat is this hat?\nThey say it'll be impossible for me to have it.\nBut I'll get it. She will be mine, and...\nwe will create a life together.\nWe're not talking about fish here, are we? - No.\nClearly talking about Cece.\nYes.\nYeah, 'cause he said\n\"fish breasts.\"\nHe said \"fish breasts.\"\nYeah.\nI mean, fish don't have boobs.\nHmm?\nHey, Jess.\nThat's my name. What's yours?\nJust kidding. I know what it is. It's Nick.\nYou okay?\nYeah.\nYou haven't stopped moving\nsince we've been talking.\nHmm?\nIt's a nice-looking dress. You look good in it.\nOh, God. Okay.\nJess! Jess, wait!\nJess... Jess, would you please wait?\nHey, I was wondering, can I get a ride to the hardware store?\nI want to throw a punching bag up at the bar for Guys' Night, but my car's not working, so can I get a ride?\nNo. Mm-mm. No.\nCome on, can I please have a ride?\nWait, hold on. Don't move. Hold on.\nYou got an eyelash.\nWhy do you smell so good?\nIt's 'cause I did laundry.\nAh. I smell like a baby in a damn meadow.\nLook at this. My underwear.\nWhat? What?\n-They're blue now. I think it's 'cause I put colors in the whites. - Uh-huh.\nI'm still figuring it out, but I'm really excited about laundry.\nGood job. - Hey, how do you put your underwear back in?\nJust... I feel like it's too big to get back in now.\nIt's tricky to get it in.\nFine!\nThank you.\nDo you mind if we stop along the way? I'm thinking of getting a salad 'cause I want to eat healthier.\nOh! God! Nick!\nI'm thinking of taking a vitamin today.\nOh, God! Shut up!\nIt's good.\nYeah.\nYank that chain.\nYank it.\nI feel like Russell Crowe in every movie he's ever done.\nAll right, Nick. Um, we have to go.\nWe just got here.\nWe have tons of stuff we need to get. - Fine.\nLet me see what we have left.\nA whole bunch of stuff.\nLong-shafted... drive drill?\nNew nut wrench?\nOur old nut wrench is bad.\nQuick-hardening... caulk.\nYou don't want to wait forever for that caulk to harden.\nLube for... drill shaft.\nAnd we ... also, can we get a box of gummy sharks?\nJust remember... you caught him pleasuring himself to a mail-order steak catalogue.\nHey, Jess, I need the cart!\nLook what I found!\nLook at this big ol' pipe.\nCheck it out, Schmidt ... I got you a clownfish.\nI don't want some janky freshwater bitch fish, Winston.\nI want a lionfish.\nLet's just cut through the crap, okay, Schmidt? We both know what you really want is Cece.\nCece the woman?\nYeah.\nYou can't put a woman in a fish tank, Winston.\nThat doesn't make any sense.\nLook, Winston, if there was one thing that stood between you and happiness, don't you think I would be there to help you get it?\nNo matter how stupid it was?\nYou're right, Schmidt.\nIf I was doing something stupid, you definitely would be involved.\nYeah, you're damn right I would be.\nAnd I would probably be there to make it even stupider.\nNow, I'm going to walk out that door, and I'm gonna pursue the object of my dreams.\nAnd if you don't want to join me, then I'm gonna carry that weight alone.\nI'm in.\nLet's get you a lionfish. Where do we start?\nWe're gonna start at the source.\nThe ocean.\nThat's an even better idea.\nHey, Jess.\nI got some hot soup.\nI feel good...\nJessy feel good...\nMmm.\nI like to say words with my mouth.\nWell, your jaw is super bruised, so you need to get some rest. But you have some fun pain meds.\nRight?\nI like you.\nYeah, I like you, too, Jess.\nYeah... and I like, your little bubble belly.\nOh, thank you.\nBlows up like a... bubble.\nYeah, that's what it does.\nI want to have sex with you!\nOkay.\nI want to have sex with you.\nWhoa, do you know what you're saying right now, Jess?\nYeah.\nAre you sure?\nI want to have sex with you.\nSexy time for you, says me.\nYou are a beautiful white man, Nick Miller.\nOkay.\nRead all about it.\nYeah.\nI'm Judy Garland.\nYeah, so it's the pills.\nThis is nonsense.\nWhoa!

Let's do this!\nAre we not... are we not doing it? It doesn't feel like you guys want to do it.\nLet's just say hypothetically that a girl says something to you while she's on painkillers.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd that girl says that she might want to have sexual intercourse with you.\nPlease tell me we're not talking about Jess.\nAnd you had no idea that's how she felt.\nLike, no idea. You thought the door was closed.\nIn fact, you thought that door was so closed that you went out to another door, but had I known that the first door was open, that's the door I wanted to walk through.\nWait, okay, wait...\nI would've walked through that door.\nDo you see how I'm in a tough spot?\nCan we stop calling it\n\"walking through a door\"?\nBecause for me, I feel like it's more like sliding past a drape.\nOkay, if a girl on painkillers says that she wants to have sex with you, Mm-hmm.\nis that the drugs or is that real?\nAnd if so, how do I end it with Shane before Jess finds out?\nI-I-I meant the door.\nNick, Jess...\nAll right, good talking, guys.\nGood stuff.

Why...\nLiterally, why are the buttons on here?\nBecause they're not holding anything together, yet I don't know which buttons are buttoned.\nHow do you get this thing off, Winston?!\nI don't understand this middle-class button system!\nGet it off of me!\n(Panting)\nSo I don't think I'm gonna go to the funeral, man.\nI think I'm gonna hang back.\nSo, um, I'm helping Nick with the eulogy.\nI'll give you the goods on Walt, Glasses Face.\nMy pop had a table at every diner in the city.\nHe had silverware from the finest hotels in the area.\nHe had a gold chain as thick as floss.\nBut, like, thick floss.\nWait, Walt's got that chain?\nYeah, he got that chain. That's his chain.\nThat was my dad's chain.\nNo, it was Walt's signature piece.\nNo, he got that from the Seiko watch deal.\nNo, he got it from the dishwasher arrangement.\nNo, he didn't. JAMIE: Yes, he did.\nMy dad took a dart in the eye for that.\nI don't care what your dad took a dart in the eye for.\nGuys. Guys, guys, guys.\nCan we refocus? JAMIE: I can't!\nBecause he's accusing my father of thievery! - Hey!\nCan we just talk about Walt? JAMIE: Yeah, so what's the deal with you and Nick? Are you guys, uh...\nCould you...\ncould you stop doing that with your eyebrows?\nPlease stop doing... Stop.\nThey're doing it. They're doing it.\nYeah.\nNo.\nWhoever denied it supplied it.\nNow, this would be the casket.\n(Sighs)\nAnd now I'm dead.\nSo approach me and don't be afraid.\nJust promise not to move, all right?\nThat's what I'm afraid of most.\nAre you k... are you kidding me?\nAlso, you can't breathe.\nSchmidt, I need to breathe, okay?\nBecause I'm coaching you, and also for regular life reasons.\nNow, just calm down, find a joyful memory and let it lift you to the sky.\n(Exhales)\n(Sighs)\nYou left us too soon, you beautiful black butterfly.\nStart over.\nYou know, when we first met, I thought that we would be rivals.\nFor Nick's attention, for who wore Easter colors best.\nAnd then rivalry became friendship.\n\n\n\n(Chuckles)\nWe've laughed, we've swum.\nYou cut my toenails.\nAre you the brother that I never had?\nNo.\nYou're the brother that I've always had.\nThat was beautiful.\n(Shouts) What are you doing, man?!\nYou moved! Whoa! What the hell?\nOf course I moved! I'm not a real dead person!\nYou ghoul!\nWhy do I do this for you?\nForget it, man. I'm never going to this thing.\nYou just made it worse.\nWhat's wrong with you?\n$2,000?\nWhat if it wasn't six feet under?\nHow much for three feet?\nI've gone through half a pack of ciggie gum here.\nYou want some of my weed?\nWhere are we on the food?\nWe-we got to have Elvis food.\nMa, I'm making calls right now.\nIt's got to be perfect.\nIt's gonna be perfect. You just got to let me do it. - If the food isn't Elvis-themed, does it matter that much?\nYou got a problem with Elvis?\nI don't... (Stammers) - No, she didn't say that. I'm gonna have to call you back.\nNo, she didn't say that. She didn't say that about Elvis. - I was just suggesting that maybe the Elvis theme doesn't matter as much...\nYou don't think Elvis is important?\nShe knows Elvis is important, Ma!\nElvis is everything!\nI know. He's the King. He's the King.\nI'm sorry, Bonnie. He's the King.\nJess.\nNick...\nI'm here to help, but I can't write this eulogy. - Wait, what?\nDo you want some of my weed? NICK: I asked you to do one thing.\nI need you to write the eulogy.\nBut I didn't know Walt.\nNobody wants to hear what I have to say about my dad.\nIt doesn't matter what you say. You just... you h...\nyou have to say good-bye to him.\nI'm not asking you to do too much.\nJust write my father's eulogy.\nI can't handle this!\nJESS: Nick. BOBBY: My dad's chain!\nJESS: Nick.

I brought Elvis!\nNICK: Funeral saved. WINSTON: What?\nHey, happy funeral, Jess.\nWhat happened?\nWhat happened is I found this guy at the bar and he fits into the costume, so for 20 bucks, he's gonna be Elvis.\nI thought you wanted me to kill Elvis for 20 bucks.\nThen why would I give you the outfit, Brendan?\nThe element of surprise?\n(Chuckling): Yeah.\nThe mirror effect?\nHe's gonna be perfect.\nMmm.\nWhose birthday is it?\nNo, it's my dad's funeral.\nI'm gonna go find cake.\nHow much have you had to drink?\nOne dozen beers.

That is rude. - I'll try.\nIt's inappropriate and it's offensive, okay?\nOkay, but I just...\nAll right? It's what I...it's what I'm thinking.\nI got this. Shh. I got this.\nJust don't say anything, okay? Come on.\nHi...\nUh... the chain.\nSome... someone should stop...\n'Cause he's taking the chain.\nHey, hey, quit it, man.\nDon't do that.\nHey, beat it, Cali.\nLong Island, son.\nI don't care.\nGet off of it, man.\nJust stop it.

Get the bull's-eye.\nI haven't seen Shivrang's penis.\nOh.\nIt's that small?\nYou still know where it goes though.\nIt just hit me. I'm about to commit the rest of my life to a man that I have never seen naked.\nCece, chances are he has, like, a standard garden-variety penis.\nAnd if we're all really honest with ourselves, isn't it all about the gonads?\nAm I right, ladies?\nNo. - No.\nI'm trying to make her feel better.\nAnd Ankita cannot hear anything about this, all right?\nShe will not understand.

We're liars, man!\nWe are throwing you a good old-fashioned American bachelor party!\nWhoops!\nBachelor party! Yeah!\nWhoa! Whoa Hey! What are you...\nWhat is wrong with you?!\n Come on, come on\n Yeah... \nI know.\nWhy don't we talk about some of the things that we love about Shivrang?\nI'll start. Um...\nhe has really good taste in magazines.\nThis sucks!\nBoring!\nSo lame. - Jess, let's put in the slideshow that you made for Cece.\nNo, I don't think that's a good idea.\nYes!

Yeah.\nThey're supposed to want commitment, right?\nBut then I offer it to them on a silver platter and they throw it back in my face like a comedy pie.\nI know this is awkward because we slept together, and I never returned any of your phone calls, so this might come as a shock to you, but... will you be my girlfriend?\nOh, God.\nI thought you had herpes.\nBut no to the girlfriend, you dick.\nDo you remember two years ago when we were watching coverage of the BP oil spill and doing it during the commercials and then you asked me if I wanted a serious relationship and I laughed in your face?\nWell, my new answer... is yes.\nBe my girlfriend!\nWhat's that all about?\nCream cheese in bulk?\nI mean, it's possible that Cece's right.\nI mean, maybe I'm just not a serious relationship kind of guy.\nWhat are you talking about?\nYou dated Elizabeth for, like...\nfor years.\nYeah.\nElizabeth?\nYeah, but Elizabeth doesn't count.\nShe was during my \"Big Guy\" period.\nSo you like the foot rub? Softer? Harder?\nThat's perfect, Big Guy.\nLook at all these little toes.\nAll my little toesies feel so good when you rub 'em, though.\nThis little... this little one went to market.\nIf Elizabeth doesn't count, then why is it seared into my brain forever?\nYou were awfully salty about that.\nShe counts.\nWe need to make Cece jealous, and I don't think that's the route we want to take.\nThen go to the wedding alone.\nOh.\nWell, then, go with Elizabeth.\nGreat idea, Winston. I'm gonna ask Elizabeth.\nYeah. You were of no help to me, Nick.\nThat's what... my whole thing about the whole thing with Elizabeth was that I was also suggesting...\nThanks, guys.\n\n\n\nYou're an idiot, dude.\nYou're the worst. You guys were...\nHow did you know we were here?\nOh! Oh, I just couldn't decide.\nYour country's refusal to embrace Robbie Williams will forever baffle me.\nWell, I got to say, we're really glad you're back at the table with us, Shivrang.\nShivrung.\nLet's play a classic bachelor party game right now.\nMm-hmm, all right.\nI'm gonna take a photo of my junk.\nOh, no, you're not.\nYeah, I am.

Yup.\nJust...\nThat is my junk in a photo. Okay.\nIt's your turn, Shivrang. Take a photo of your junk.\nOh, no. No, thanks.\nWe're all doing it.\nNo, it's not... Absolutely not.\nI'm begging you. - But I will get us another round of drinks.\nTake the photo...\nTake the picture, Shivrang.\nWho fancies a shandy?\nWhat the hell is that?\nIt's a drink.\nTwo for you guys coming right up.\nCece actually designed that toilet.\nCece was a volunteer nurse, and, um...\nNo bottoms?\nYou know, what-what happens in Orlando stays in Orlando.\nNadia, seriously, turn it off.\nCece, is this how you like to spend time with your friends?\nIs this the kind of wife you want to be?\nNo, no. It's not at all, okay?\nI didn't even know this party was happening.\nIt was a surprise.\nI promise you, this is so not me.\nI didn't want any of it.\nCece, you wanted a bachelorette party ever since I've known you.\nWhy do you have to pretend to be somebody you're not?\nWhat are you saying? - I'm just saying, this is all moving really, really fast, and maybe you need to get to know Shivrang a little bit more, and maybe you need to slow this down so he can get to know you.\nI'm getting married in three weeks.\nAre you saying that I shouldn't get married in three weeks?\nNo. I'm just saying that maybe you should...\nI knew it! I knew it!\nYou have been against this wedding from the beginning.\nFine! I don't think you should marry Shivrang if it means you have to change who you are.\nYeah, well, I don't need to take relationship advice from a girl who's in the middle of a seventh grade debacle with a boy across the hall!\nOh! - \"Oh, I'm a single adult, and I kissed another\n\"single adult.

This is fun.\nAre you thinking what I'm thinking?\nYeah.\nFire...!\nOh!\nReal fire. This fire is real.\nFire!\nWhoa!\nWhat are you doing? You were supposed to take the picture.\nAah!

I have to talk to her.\nOh, you're... We're all in the same car. Ugh!\nYou know, I'm gonna take care of this.\nHow are you gonna take of this?\nCrop, rotate, rotate... and send.\nWhat are you doing?\nI mean, this.\nI just send a picture of your penis to Jess... - No!\n...and told her it was Shivrang's.\nNo!\nSo now, we good.\nYou did not just do that.\nOh.\nShivrang.\nWhat, Shivrang? Shivrang, what?\nWhat?\nNo, nothing. It's nothing.

What do you want?\nI would like to take you to a wedding, because I miss you so much...\nNo, I can't take you seriously when you're wearing such tight pants.\nGet to the point.\nOkay, look, my model ex-girlfriend is getting married to some small little Indian man who I just don't understand.\nOkay, and I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend so she gets very sad, and then, breaks off the wedding, and then, runs away with me.\nNo. Not a chance.\nNo?\nWait, wait, wait, please.\nElizabeth?\nI'm only gonna say this once.\nYou were the greatest boyfriend.\nI loved Big Guy.\nBut then, you lost weight, and you got mean.\nYou stopped listening to me.\nYou changed completely.\nYou stopped paying for my dinner.\nElizabeth, to be fair, at that point, you were eating the lion's share of the food.\nAnd you were sitting there eating one basil leaf, looking like an idiot panda bear.\nWell...\nLook, I loved Big Guy with all my heart.\nBut I have no interest in helping the guy who's standing in front of me now.\nI hate your hair.\nAnd I looked, and I looked, and I couldn't find it. Where is it?\nAnd then, I realized, uh-oh.\nThat is not his leg.\nOh, hey, uh, Jess, uh, please tell me...\nHey... that nobody's looked at your photos in your phone.\nUm... you're too late.\nCece looked at it.\nWe all looked at it.\nPrize hog, Shivrang.\nYeah...\nI'm so sorry they made you do it.\nOh, it's okay.\nActually, it wasn't mine.\nWhat?! - What?!\nWhose was it?\nIt was mine.\nWhat?!

Are you, like, a couple now? Have you thought any of this through? Nick, please help me, okay? Stop being so selfish and just help me.\nOkay, you know what?

It's Jess Well, Winston, after 25 unanswered text messages to Nick and Jess this morning, I finally received a response.\nA smiley face.\nThis leaves us with one choice - To become best friends.\nHuh? Yeah, fine.\nFor r? Okay, great.\nNow, as my best friend, I expect you to be willing to sacrifice everything for me at a moment's notice, including, of course, unfortunately for you, your dignity.\nYeah, fine.\nWinston, what can I do for you? Don't talk to me that much, never lie to me, and never, ever touch my puzzle.\nWinston, do we do we think now is really the right time to be starting a puzzle? I'm great at puzzles.\nYou're a born puzzler, Winston, sure, um, but don't you agree that sometimes, when you start puzzles, you get a little bit weird? And, I don't know, intense? Spend a lot of time humming.\nAlso spend a lot of time naked.\nI'm gonna do you, puzzle! Right on the table.\nAs nasty as you want to be.\nHey, Schmidt, what do you think it's gonna look like? What do I think it's going to look like? - Yeah, the puzzle.\nWinston, it's on the box.\nThe the picture's on the box.\nIt's a Japanese garden! Schmidt, calm down.\nWhat is your problem? Two women are in love with me.\nThe problem is, is I'm in love with both of them.\nOkay, looks like you're gonna have to choose.\nCece and I, we have this connection.\nYou know, it's physical it's unhealthy.\nLook, I don't want to get too graphic with you, but I'm not just the plug with her.\nI'm also a socket.\nGod okay, fine.\nSchmidt, choose Cece.\nYeah, but - I was dating Elizabeth first, so - Mm-hmm.\nWait a minute Winston I was dating Elizabeth first.\nYou want to know what I think? - No, I don't.\nDone.\nDecided.\nHa!

Way to talk that out.\nYeah.\nBest friends.\nBest friends.\nThis is gonna work out, man.\nYeah, it's gonna work out, man.\nPuzzling Winston is about to do some puzzling About to get into some puzzle troubling So, in conclusion, it's a you know, it's a very difficult decision that I've had to that, you know, that you guys have put me in, here, but I just I'm gonna be candid.\nI've been up for 24 hours.\nI have to return all of these gifts.\nSo just say it.\nYou don't want to be with me.\nWh huh? Look look at that.\nI just looked down and I thought, \"This girl must be wearing sneakers \"with shoelaces, and th-those shoelaces must be tied together, because this girl is straight trippin', yo.\n\" - What? - Of course I want to be with you.\nBut I feel so terrible for Elizabeth.\nHow did she take it? Sh She took it.\nIn the marketplace of ideas, where culture is king, and data moves faster than people, where scalable opportunities come from turnkey solutions What are you trying to say, Schmidt? Is it over? No no.\nAs if.\nOf course I picked you.\nIt wasn't even close.\nCome here, you crazy white girl.\nThere it is.\nPoor Cece.\nUh, yeah, okay.\nOh I fell asleep.\nHow long have you been driving? Those cops look like they're about 15 and they have huge guns.\nJess, are we in Mexico? All in! We're in Mexico! Oh, my God, pull over! That pi\u00c3\u00b1ata's shaped like a monkey! You know what? It's gonna be weird going back to having sex without a bunch of feral dogs watching.\nWhy am I not hungry? I should be hungry.\nRemember when we lived in that loft, and, like, we had all those problems? Yeah.\nAll in! Voice mail? Again? Where have you been? It's been four days, man.\nHave you really been doing it with Jess this whole time? That's disgusting.\nNick, I did something really wrong, and, uh I just I need to talk to you.\nI need to talk to my friend.\nCome home.\nYeah, I should try him again.\nDial best friend one.\nLet's stay here.\nWe're totally out of money.\nWe got this great setup.\nNo, this is not gonna last long.\nIt's not gonna last long.\nIt isn't.\nThis is a badly built shelter.\nWe'll go right there.\nHow hard could that place be to sneak into? You all in? Nick, this has been fun, but Okay, look, everything that's bad is waiting for us back in the loft.\nBut here? I'm Paradise Nick.\nAnd Paradise Nick is mega-chill.\nAnd you're Paradise Jess, right? We can make food and just - All in.\nAll in.\nIt don't work like that.\nIf you uh Hey, man, how'd she take it? Devastated.\nI'm sure glad that's settled.\nHey, man, I'm gonna go shower.\nI'm proud of you.\nI know it must have been tough.\nHey, Schmidt, who do you call if puzzle pieces are broken? Oh.\nHey, Winston.\nIs, uh, is Schmidt home? Cece.\nOh, my goodness.\nHi.\nDo you need a hug? All right.\nIs Schmidt even here, Winston?

He made love to her.\nWinston made love to Elizabeth.\nAfter I chose you, Winston was all too quick, in Elizabeth's vulnerable state, to rush in there and just get his jollies off.\nHis sweaty, disgusting jollies.\nSeriously? I mean, she must have just been so upset and hurt I didn't even know you were interested in her.\nTell her what you did, Winston, and give her the short version, which you did not give to Elizabeth.\nWha? What I did um Okay, well, I drove over there to seduce her.\nAnd I seduced her two and a half times.\nPuzzle me this, then, Winston How do you live with yourself? I have a bit of a hard time believing that Winston would do this.\nWell, then, you obviously don't know Winston, 'cause he's a sick, disgusting human being.\nJust this morning he asked me for a pair of your underpants.\nWinston? - Hmm? Is that true? Yes.\nI needed your underwear to sew into my underwear.\nOh my God.\nThat is disgusting! You are a pervert! Oh, I'm so sorry, Cece.\nJust wait in the car.\nYou don't have to deal with this disgusting trash person, garbage child! You're upset.\nAs you should be.\nOh, but that was great, man.\nHow long as this been going on, man? Four days.\nFour days, and you didn't tell me? Come on, Schmidt! I said, \"Don't lie to me.\n\" I'm sorry.\nAll right? I love both of these women and I couldn't decide.\nI needed to buy some more time.\nCece thinks I'm wearing her panties right now! Well, that's on you, man! You freaked out super hard! You-you kidding me? That's so weird.\nSewing people's panties into underpants.\nLook, we're not best friends, Schmidt.\nAs a matter of fact, we're not friends at all until you fix this.\nOkay, all right, look.\nWinston, I'm sorry, man.\nW-Winston, you've been working on this puzzle for quite some time now.\nYou realize a lot of those puzzle pieces are upside down, right? It's just they're cardboard color.\nIs that an almond that you have inserted into one of the pieces? Are you just eating them, or are you using them as pieces? You know that's an almond, right? Schmidt, come here! Free cocktails.\nNo way! - Yeah, fitting right in.\nOh, my God.\nWhat? Security guard.\nFreeze.\nOkay, don't freeze.\nThat looks weird.\nDid he notice you?

One day, you're gonna meet a girl, you're gonna really like her, and you're gonna want to give her everything, but you won't be able to afford it because your life's kind of in shambles and you don't have money.\n\n\n\nLook at you, kid, you got a great-looking face.\nI don't know, you might have a tough go of it.\nWhat do I know?

Okay, not getting involved starting now.\nI'm with Nick here.\nYou remember how hard he took it when Lance got busted.\nHe just stared at that yellow bracelet and cried.\nI know you're right, but - You're coming in? - It's just like he's had this crazy energy lately.\nAnd did you see how insane he was when we were talking about the double date? Also, he has just, like, stopped blinking.\nIs that whippits? - Well, Nick can talk to him.\nNo, I'm not gonna talk to him.\nI called that I wasn't gonna be involved; those calls have to be respected.\nIf you talk to him, I'll give you a treat.\nBedroom treat or kitchen treat?

No, n-n-n-n-no.\nLook, there's got to be something that you can do.\nWell, you could try your luck at the community table.\nCommunity hell, no.\nListen, um, sorry, you don't understand.\nThis has to be an official reservation.\nNo.\nI'll tell you what, maybe this will change your mind.\n\"I owe you a hundred dollars.\n\" Oh, hell no.\nNo, that that was supposed to be a ten.\nWhoa, you got there faster than I thought.\nHey, so this is weird and it's only gonna take a second of your time, but, uh and I probably already know the answer, but are you on drugs? I know the answer is no, so I'll just see you later, man.\nGet in my room.\nDon't want to be part of it! Did you crack my e-mail password? How did you guess \"Smithereens\"? Are you really on drugs?

You're going to get mad at me.\nI'm your best friend.\nOkay, I was there for you when you fell off the deck at Chester's graduation.\nOh, no.\nAnd I'm here for you now.\nThere's nothing you could say that I'd get mad at.\nO okay, um, I can do this.\nDo you know how I broke up with Elizabeth so that I could start dating Cece again? Absolutely, and it was really hard for you.\nYeah, that actually never happened.\nWhat do you mean? I'm still dating Elizabeth.\nWhat do you mean? I'm dating both of them, and neither one of them knows it, and I feel terrible about it.\nBut Elizabeth is gone.\nWhat do you mean? - She's not gone.\nSo you broke up with Cece - I didn't break up with either one of them.\nWhat do you mean? You process this however you need to process it.\nIf you want to keep talking it out - Which one are you dating? - Both.\nAre you dating Cece? - I'm dating Cece.\nAre you dating Elizabeth? - Yes.\nHow do you do that? - They made me choose.\nYou have to choose.\nYou can't have both women.\nWhat was I supposed to do?

This is the way the world works! - Why?! - I don't know.\nI feel terrible about this, I don't know what to do.\nHow could you do this with Jess's best friend? I don't know, I feel really badly about it! In your little brain, how do you see this ending? I see it ending badly.\nI see it ending very, very badly.\nBut you know what? I just I want to thank you, though, just for being there for me and for listening to me.\nNo.\nI'm not listening to you and I'm not there for you.\nBecause now we're in this together.\nWe're not in this together and I'm not listening and I'm not being there, so just stop telling me things! What would you like me to do with this information? Well, it really helped me to tell you.\nYou should tell somebody, get it off your chest.\nI can't.\nYou know what I mean? - Like who? Well, certainly not Jess.\nDon't ever tell Jess.\nThe one person you can't tell is Jess.\nHello, Picca? Yes, I need a table for five.\nThis is author Toni Morrison.\nI am? Well, oh, yeah? Well, I think you're a woman! Hello?

Oh, yes.\nSorry about that.\nLook at us.\nCommunity table, like a little community.\nCall that seat.\nThat's my seat.\nCome on.\nYeah.\nOh, no, where are y'all going? Dibs on those seats, dibs on that.\nPut that for me right there.\nHey, put that right there for me.\nThat was amazing.\nJess, you know so many Spaceballs quotes.\nThey jam the radar with literal jam.\nOh, hey, did you ever talk to Schmidt? What's going on, Nick? Schmidt! Hey! My best friend?! You Long Island street trash! Damn it, Nick, you told her? No, he didn't tell me! I I happened upon it.\nOh, you happened upon it?

Double date night! What's, uh, what's going on? Tell her.\nTell her.\nOkay, okay.\nWe're taking two cars.\nIt's faster that way because of gas.\nNo phones.\nWhat? Here you go; I got the door, it's okay.\nGo! Go! Cigarette, phone call, bathroom.\nOkay.\nSir, you're clearly alone.\nWe're gonna need this table.\nOkay, so what do you think that over the past two hours, I, as a single person, have ordered eight separate entrees and have taken bites of different sizes of each of them to create some sort of pointless illusion? Do you know how insane you sound? God, I hate this job.\nYou need to slow down.\nI got it.\nDon't worry.\nWhat's going on, man? You guys were acting all so weird back there, - and you're driving like a maniac.\nOh, geez.\nYou know, I didn't want to have to say anything, but What? Here we go.\nNick is cheating on Jess! Aah! - What?! Apparently, they met at some gas station.\nShe's much older.\nMuch, much older.\nDeeply Korean.\nI just found out.\nAnd, I mean, Nick is my best friend and all, but I can't even be in the same room as that scumbag right now! Oh, I'm so mad! I'm just so, so mad! I'm terribly angry about the whole situation.\nI can't even drive.\nTake the wheel.\nOh, why, God?! He was the best of us! - Cece, please.\nYou're veering everywhere.\nSorry.\nOh, Nick, go, go! We're gonna lose them! You keep nerd-stopping at every sign! Look, if I get another ticket, they're gonna make me wear eyeglasses.\nWhy didn't you get involved back there? Look, look, here's the reality.\nYes, Schmidt is my best friend, and he's also really scary.\nYou are so afraid of everything.\nOh, really? Would a man afraid of everything - put his finger in a cigarette lighter? - I don't know Don't do that.\nThat's just stupid! - I'm not gonna do that.\nYou wimp.\n\n\n\nOh, my gosh! Oh, my God! - Jess, are you okay? - It really hurts.\nOh, my Lord, are - It's so hot! - Come here.\nAre you okay? - Yeah.\nAre you okay? Look, I'm gonna do it.\nOw! Oh.\nWhy did you do that? So that we were both in the same amount of pain! I'm gonna junk-punch him.\nTurn the car around.\nWe're going to the restaurant.\nWhy would you ? That seems rash.\nMaybe I don't know.\nMaybe staying away for a while, or at least I don't know talking about it, hearing his side.\nI don't Cheating is selfish, and it is cowardly, and there is no excuse for it.\nThe only thing that you can do is punch it in the junk.\nOr you could really understand it emotionally from their point of view.\nYou don't know.\nMaybe they had a tough childhood.\nTurn the car around, Schmidt.\nMaybe their mom's a lesbian.\nI don't know.\nTurn the car around! Yeah, let's do it.\nLet's turn the car around.\nLet's go to Picca.\nI'm gonna turn the car around as soon as I turn this Turn the car around Schmidt! - As soon as I turn the car around.\nNow!

Hit me back.\nWinnie the Bish.\nWe're never gonna find this restaurant; maybe we should just go home.\nThere it is! - Here it is.\nWelcome! - Can I have your car, sir? - Oh.\nSir? Sir? Sir? I'm on the phone.\nAll right, time's up.\nYou got to get out of here.\nUh, th that's my friend.\nThat's my friend.\nSee? See? I told you all.\nHuh? I got friends.\nEverybody? Hmm? That's my friend right there.\nWhere the hell is Nick?! How did I even beat him here?! - That was the slowest ride of my entire life! - Oh, Jess Literally, my grandmother drives faster than that.\nLook, she's my best friend.\nYeah.\nAnd Schmidt is mine.\nThat's why I didn't want to get involved.\nWell, when someone I love gets hurt, I get involved.\nSir? What's up, big cat? Sir? Sir? Well, you got to go in there, and you got to face her.\nLook, it's not about Cece.\nThis is about the $12 valet.\nIt's $12 to ? One sec.\nHey, it's self-park! The maroon car is self-park! It's an excessive amount of money.\nI didn't mean for any of this to happen.\nLook, I know you didn't, okay? But now it's time you do the right thing, Schmidt.\nI can't go in there.\nWell, I can't let Jess tell her.\nHello? Open the door.\nWait, Cece! - Oh, Jess, I have something to tell you.\nI have something to tell you! What? No, I have something I need to tell you.\nOh, my God, what are you doing, Cece?!

Everybody knows anyway, Schmidt.\nMight as well just say it.\nOh, let's talk.\nLet's we this should be fine.\nI didn't want to hurt you.\nYou have to know that I did not want to hurt you.\nPlease, I I'm begging you.\nIf you take anything away from this, know that I did not want to hurt you.\nI didn't want to hurt anyone.\nEspecially you.\nYou have no idea what you mean to me.\nAnd I got caught up in this thing, and I used to be so fat.\nI mean, like truly gigantic.\nI mean, as big as as big as big as it gets.\nAnd now and now I'm not, and girls like me, and I don't I don't know how to do this.\nI got lost.\nAnd I'm sorry.\nYou're sorry? You didn't want to hurt anybody? That's the best you can do, Schmidt? Really? I don't know.\nI don't know you.\nGood-bye, Schmidt.\nI'm just realizing that I don't have any cash on me.\nIf anyone would be willing to loan me $12 for the valet, that would be greatly appreciated.\nCece still hasn't called me.\nDo you think you could test my phone again? I can't.\nI don't have any more minutes.\nMinutes, Nick?! Who still has minutes on their phone?! I bought 10,000 minutes in I'm sorry.\nI just I I really want to be there for her.\nYou are, okay? And she'll call, 'cause she needs you.\nHell.\nThis is a real butt munch of a situation we're in.\nYeah.\nLook I'm here for you.\nThere is nothing I know more than the fact that I want to be with you, Jess, okay? Unless we're driving.\nYou admitted to driving while legally blind! No, because you're honestly the worst backseat You're honestly telling me what to do the entire time! - Legally blind.\nWhoever has the wheel controls the car! You liar! Here's your pie! You broke my heart.\nMail me my mouth guard.\nIn case you were wondering if Cece had Elizabeth's number, sh she does.\nSo, tough time in Schmidtsburg, wouldn't you say? Just a quick heads-up, Nick, Jess.\nI blame you for this whole thing.\nYou can't seriously - I was going to fix it.\nI wasn't going to hurt anyone.\nBut, since you took it upon yourself to hurt both of them, should it take me the rest of my life, I'm going to break the two of you up.\nBring it, Schmidt.\nIt's impossible.\nWe're really strong.\nIt will be when you least expect it, which might be when you most expect it.\nCould actually be when you're watching the movie version of What to Expect When You're Expecting.\nRegardless I am coming for you.\nOh, my God, Schmidt is so scary.\nYou were right.\nWe have to talk about the things - that he could use to pull us apart, okay? - Okay.\nOkay.\nOkay, politics.\nYou're a Democrat, I've never voted.\nI'm in the Green Party.\nOh, that is so annoying.\nOkay, I have been banned for my lifetime from Lake Ontario.\nDon't ask.\nOkay.\nWhat else do you have? - My fear of pears.\nOkay, you're afraid of pears? And pear-shaped people.\nUm, that's interesting.\nI'm not convinced I know how to read.\nI've just memorized a lot of words.\nThe doctors say I might grow another 18 inches.\nThat's a different image of you, but I'm gonna get past that, and I'm past it.\nOkay, the moon landing - Uh, which is obviously fake.\nNo, it's not obviously fake.\nNo, that's actually not what - Are you crazy?

Uh, okay.\nWell, um, I don't know, maybe, uh, she could come over sometime? Like, our cats could go on a date?

Last night, Nick struggled with impotence.\nOh, my God, I'm not talking you about this.\nJess, look, I get it.\nYou don't want my help, but just do me a favor please.\nLet me know when you're not mad at me anymore so I can tell you about how men crave danger and variety in their sexual lives.\nI just hope it's not too late, fingers crossed.\nWhat are you talking about? I mean, I don't care, but if I did theoretically.\nTheoretically, I would tell you for-for a man whose midsection is basically mush, Nick has had a lot of sex.\nHe's pushed that mush all over town.\nAnd you know what, he's got some very weird taste.\nDark, real fringe stuff.\nHe likes stuff that they don't even have p0rn for.\nAnd you know, a lot of women wouldn't think to do the Captain - in-in bed.\nWhat? That was a mistake.\nI shouldn't have said anything.\nI didn't want to talk about the Captain.\nIt was a thing, and I did and Do you want a smoothie? What's the Captain? Well, it starts off with But you want to clean yourself up immediately.\nI mean immediately.\nAnd then you How comfortable are you with racial slurs?

Fatty wants to see your room.\nThat's awesome.\nGreat news.\nYou hear that, Furguson? - Y'all go play.\nYeah? There you go.\nHe was nervous.\nWell, good thing I brought this.\nYeah, we can't give wine to these cats.\nIt's been a tough six months, and this cat needs a drink so O-Okay.\nI don't think they care.\nThey're not listening at all.\nMm-mm.\nThey're too into each other.\nYeah.\nNick, we have to talk about this, okay? All right, I'll go first.\nListen I was uncomfortable with some of the specifics of what we just did.\nFor example, when I said, \"You like that, huh?\" I felt like you really, really didn't like it.\nHow do you feel? I just I feel like, you know No, it's just kind of like be I mean Uh It was good, you know.\nIt's over.\nLove sleeping birdsty.\nI just want to know what I did wrong.\nHow does the Captain normally go?\nThe what?\nThe Captain.\nWhat we just did.\nI've never done that in my life.\nWe did that because you wanted to, Jess.\nWhat?! Why would I want to do that? That's degrading to not only women but all of mankind, Nick.\nI know.\nI only did that 'cause Schmidt told me it was your favorite thing Did you say, 'cause Schmidt said? No, no, no, no.\nDid you just Did you talk to tight pants and eyebrows Who was I supposed to talk to, Nick? Every time I tried to talk to you about your penis problems, you went to move your car.\nThose aren't penis problems.\nWhat is Did you talk to Winston about my penis problems? - What about Cece, did she get a call? - He wasn't around.\nSchmidt told me he had a PhD in Nickology.\nHe doesn't.\nThere's no such We have to talk about our feelings 'cause we're together.\nIf we needed to talk about feelings, they would be called \"talkings.\"\n\n\n\nNo, that is not true.\nNick - That is 100% - This is it This is Schmidt getting in our heads.\nI'm going to kill him! - Jessica, wait.\nSchmidt! I can't run that fast The Captain! I trusted you.\nYou took advantage of me.\nSomething wrong? - You set us up.\nI've done things to Nick I can't ever undo.\nYou see, your fatal flaw Communication.\nYou won't shut up about your feelings, and the only thing this dummy wants to talk about is the Chicago Brown Bears.\nIt's just the Chicago Bears.\nThere's no brown Who cares? I put a pebble in your path and the two of you cracked your tiny little skulls on it.\nOoh, by the way, how was the Captain? Did you make it all the way to the spyglass? Yes, Schmidt! And my night vision's very good 'cause my eyes are so buggy and big and I saw everything and I can't erase it from my memory.\nPlease, Jess, stop talking about the Captain.\nWhy don't we just go back to being roommates.\nOkay? Nick, what do you say? The floor is yours.\nYou want to tell us how you feel? - Me? - Yeah.\nWell I think it's I just Beautifully said.\nThank you, Nick.\nEnjoy your breakup.\nIf you need me, I'll be in my room listening to mainstream hip-hop.\nStop! I have feelings.\nI didn't like when you did the Captain.\nIt made me feel bad.\nOkay, I've I've never seen this sober before.\nStop, it's my turn.\nYou talk too much and it frustrates me.\nSometimes you talk even after you've fallen asleep.\nHow do you breathe? Where do you get the words? But it doesn't matter, Jess, because I like you a lot.\nBut maybe do that less, okay? Nick, I just feel Sorry.\nI'm so sorry.\nJust keep going.\nI don't know.\nUm I really like the instrument of the cello.\nI like the cell a lot, and I don't talk about it a lot but I should because I feel very passionate about it.\nIt's a beautiful instrument.\nIt's like a guitar but it stands up.\nI once saw a zebra named Gavin give birth at the zoo, and I cried hysterically.\nAnd then I bought one of those stretched out pennies that you can get to remember it and then I lost that and I cried again.\nSometimes when I smell dust in like an attic or something, like that mothy, dusty, I think about my mother.\nWhen I was 14, I saw my mother change, and I saw her whole body naked without underpants on.\nI really like when a rap song uses a choir.\nIt makes me feel really happy when all those ladies' voices come in and then the guy's rapping.\nI think it's awesome.\nI'm really proud of you, Nick.\nI really like.\nI like you, too.\nAnd it's been a month and I'm not scared.\nUnless you're doing the Captain, and then I experience very real fear and it's very visceral Just kiss me.\nNo kissing in the living room!

All right, we live here.\nWhere are we supposed to go? This is my fault.\n'Cause I'm going through a sexual awakening.\nIt's like I'm tapping into this raw sexual energy that the universe is putting forth.\nAnd it's just both imploding and exploding at the same time.\nAnd it's kind of like I'm a young nun.\nAnd Nick is my sexy monseigneur.\nAnd I'm a I'm just going to shut up.\nBoth of you need to shut up, okay? You're having sex, not inventing.\nIt can't be that good.\nIt's good.\nStop saying, \"Squeeze my biscuits.\n\" - I'm serious, Nick.\nSorry.\nAnd, Schmidt, stop taking it out on everybody else, man.\nDeal with your breakups.\nAin't no way in hell I got a cat brothel going on in my room and I'm the only normal person in this loft.\nYou did a bad thing.\nDeal with it.\nWhat's that?

I guess this is the air you breathe, but it's nice.\nI feel like I'm on this whole new planet.\nHow about your two favorite planets? Oh, yeah, those are great.\nBut I also feel like being with you, I've finally, for the first time, and I know this sounds crazy, but I can see the stars.\nYou know, the other great thing about talking about our feelings is we don't need to do it all the time.\nThank you for expressing that.\nI feel like I can see you - Uh-huh.\nin 3-D vision.\nEveryone see in 3-D.\nHmm.\nSo, would you like to take my bra off, or should I?

The ghost situation.\nI brought you guys in here to talk about Schmidt.\nI'm really worried about him.\nHe hasn't been to work for three days.\nHe just sits on the couch eating cold cuts and yelling at the news about how nothing matters.\nIt's a problem.\nRight.\nBe honest, it's a real problem.\nHe's just going through a whole thing, you know? The Cece-Elizabeth breakup has gotten to him.\nRight now he is completely unhinged.\nY'all feel that? - What is going on? Not saying there's a ghost, but I felt a weird breeze go through my body, - that's all I'm saying.\nThere's no ghost.\nGuys, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I miss the old Schmidt.\nI want him to be happy again.\nHe's crumbling before our very eyes.\nAnd I'm having a party tonight, and I just can't have him lying on the couch, wiping his tears with deli meat.\nI'll talk to him, okay? - Thank you.\nPeople get weird with breakups.\nTrust me, I got this.\nYou got this.\nThat was Winston.\nWas that you or was that in here, dude? - That was Don't do that!

He doesn't get like this often.\nBut when he does, oh, there is an option.\nNick, I think it's time for Schmidt - to get a letter from an old friend.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\nWhat old friend? - Forget you heard anything.\nWhat old friend? - Nothing, J - We need him, Nick.\nNo, we don't.\nWe got to bring him back.\nBring who back? - Winston, don't do this! - Guys, does nobody listen to me?! - without him! - Who is he? - Michael Keaton.\nYou stupid Michael Keaton, the actor? The Batman? Nick, are you gonna tell her, or should I? - I'm not telling her.\nFine.\nI'll do it.\nYou will? - When Schmidt was seven years old You're a terrible storyteller.\nI'll just do it myself, I guess.\nWhen Schmidt was seven years old, his daddy divorced his mommy And Schmidt was left without the love of a father.\nHe didn't take it well.\nHe began an endless cycle of crying and chocolate.\nMrs.\nSchmidt tried everything to cheer him up, but nothing worked.\nDesperate, she looked to the stars.\nMovie stars.\nMrs.\nSchmidt wrote that little fat loser a letter of support from the star of his favorite movie, Batman.\nBut not the confusing new one.\nThe good one, with Michael Keaton.\nAnd when Schmidt got his disgusting chubby hands on Keaton's letter, his life changed forever.\nYes! But the real trouble was just beginning.\nYou see, Schmidt wrote back.\nAnd he kept writing back about any problem he faced: bullies, schoolwork, public erections.\nAnd for every letter he sent, Michael Keaton sent one back.\nWas Winston's version shorter? Then one day, that tubby goon went off to college.\nWhoa.\nSo Mrs.\nSchmidt unloaded the secret on her son's only friend, a man named me.\nIt was me.\nYeah, I got that.\nReally? People don't No, I got it.\nCollege proved tough for Schmidt, and old patterns soon returned.\nIt became impossible to study, and I knew what I had to do.\nAnd again - New message.\nIt worked.\nWith Keaton in his corner, he pulled himself away from that bag of turkey - and became a man.\nOne He lost five pounds, gained confidence with women and he saw the hit movie Multiplicity - 25 times.\nOh, my God.\nYou've been cat fishing Schmidt.\nDo you think we could use this whole Michael Keaton thing - to turn Schmidt around? - Absolutely.\nGreat! - But I won't do it.\nWhy not? - Because I put it to bed, okay? It's over.\nHe'll do anything Keaton says.\nThe letters are too powerful.\nI'm lying to my best friend.\nAnd I also feel like I'm betraying the real Keaton, who I really love.\nWell, then why did you tell me that whole story, Nick? Because it's a great story, and I'm a teller of stories.\nBut I won't do it.\nSorry.\nYou think you tell that story better than me? Look, you leave out way too many details, man.\nYou don't just say he was chewing a candy bar.\nYou say he was chewing on a nougat-y candy bar.\nThat's not the kind of writer I am.\nI don't say words like \"nougat-y.\n\" I'm simple.\nI'm like Hemingway.\nHey, Cece.\nOh, hey.\nI came to find out if you're coming to my party today.\nYou never answered my e-mail.\nYeah, I meant to, uh to tell you I can't make it.\nSorry.\nUm I've been going out drinking a lot lately.\nIt's kind of wiping me out.\nPlease come to my party, Cece.\nIt's Schmidt, you know? - I don't think I'm ready for that, so - Yeah.\nWhat if I could promise you Schmidt wouldn't be there? Who wants candy? - Did you go trick-or-treating? - No.\nI was out, I had my errand tote, and a couple of neighbors gave me candy.\nIs that trick-or-treating? Yes, that's the definition of trick-or-treating, Jess.\nHello! Uh, Jess, I'd like you to know that I've changed my mind, and I won't be coming to your party tonight.\nI've been e-mailing with an old friend of mine, and he made me realize - that I should give Cece her space.\nAn old friend, huh? Well, Nick knows.\nYou know, I don't like to throw his name around because I don't like people treating me any differently, but It's Michael Keaton.\nWhat?! Uh, okay.\nCalm down.\nThe actor?! Seriously, you guys.\nDon't treat me any different.\nHe's kind of my friend.\nMichael Keaton.\nThere was one time he e-mailed me.\nHe said he was my best friend.\nAnyway, we have so much catching up to do, me and Michael, so just enjoy the night.\nThat's crazy, Schmidt.\nAh, man.\nWhat did you do? - Jessica Damn Day.\nI just got Schmidt to not come to the party.\nKeaton hasn't written Schmidt in three years.\nWe have no idea how Schmidt is gonna react.\nIf Schmidt finds out Keaton isn't real, it'll destroy the entire life he has built around him.\nWe are talking about a Truman Show situation.\nOh, yeah, I love that movie.\nWhat part are you talking about? Well, I'm talking about the part in the movie when Truman realizes that his whole life is a lie, and then he goes crazy.\nYeah, yeah, yeah, right there in the middle of the movie.\nNo, it's the whole movie.\nOh, yeah, I know, I was just 'cause there's the one - There's like a scene.\nYou haven't seen it.\nHe didn't see the movie.\nOkay, guys, he almost found out once.\nNow, luckily, I handled it.\nI don't understand.\nIn 1995, he told me specifically that he had never been to Nicaragua.\nIt doesn't make any sense.\nAah! You have no idea what you've done.\nHey, uh, you guys, do you think that it's too early to e-mail Michael back? Should I send him an e-card? Does that change anything, or does that change everything? - I think you're overthinking it.\nYou know what? - You're right.\nYou're right.\nBe cool.\nI think I'm way too up here, all upstairs.\nGot to bring it down here to here.\nNot any lower, though.\nIt's not like that.\nI know it's not.\nBro, it's not like that.\nNo one thinks it is, bro.\nCool.\nAll right.\nHe's already getting weird.\nHere.\nNo, Je You come to the master.\nWhat are you writing? I fixed it again.\nYou're welcome again.\nSo you just wrote from Keaton, \"I'm going on vacation\"? He would never write that, Jess.\nWhy not? - Vacation?! Oh, Michael, you stop going away.\nI knew this would happen.\nHey, Schmidt.\nSchmidty.\nHe left me again.\nIt makes sense.\nWhy would a guy like Michael Keaton be friends with me anyway? I'm sure he likes you a lot, Schmidt.\nWhy would he? I guess I'll just always be the fat boy who eats fat-boy cheese.\nI didn't want to have to do this.\nOh, is that really necessary, Nick? - Shh.\nWhat? Let him work.\nI'm kind of like his Robin.\nYou're not like my Robin.\nYou want to be Robin? He doesn't have all the responsibilities of Batman, but he can take some of the glory.\nRobin's a joke.\nRobin's the joke.\nI think we can all agree.\nThe kids look up to him, you know, in the community.\nI haven't been inside Keaton's mind in a long time, and I need my proper inspiration.\nThank you.\nWhy do you have a picture of a bear? The great Michael Keaton attacks each new role with the ferocity of a hungry brown bear.\nIt is his entire acting philosophy, which I totally made up.\nI sleep with this person.\nSpeak to me, Keaton.\nMmm.\nHere we go.\nOh, hey, Nick, that's incredible.\n\"Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it\"? Yes, I stole that from Nelson Mandela.\nI added the part about the Penguin and the Riddler.\nOh.\nAll right.\nIs that him? Did it work?\nHe wrote back smiley face.\nHe wrote back smiley face.\nHe wrote back smiley face.\n\n\n\nTrick or treat!\nOh, how adorable.\nYou know, I just got a treat, too.\nIt's not candy; I'm not a Not a dumb little baby like all of you.\n\"Happy Hallow's Eve.\n\" And send.\nJust give us our candy.\nHush, little boy.\nHe wrote back.\n\"Hi.\n\" - Okay, I got this.\n\"Speak to me, old chum.\n\"I canceled my trip to provide earthquake relief.\nThis seemed more important.\n\" Boom.\nThat's so good.\nYeah, it's pretty good.\nYou really have the Keaton voice down.\n\"You're a friend for life.\n\" - That's good.\n\"M.\nK.\n\" - I think that's good.\nI think that's really good, actually.\nHi.\nWelcome.\nHappy Halloween.\nDrinks are over there.\nHey.\nHi.\nWhat are you supposed to be? - I'm Joey Ramona Quimby.\nI don't get it.\nJoey Ramone a Quimby.\nWhat are you? You look like you're just wearing trash from your car.\nNo, I'm not.\nI'm the Paper Mountain Trash King I just got trash from my car.\nAnd now the man who once played center for the New York Knicks in the nude, David Letterman! - That is a terrible Letterman.\nReally? People at work tell me I look just like Dave.\nYou look just like Letterman.\nYou know, I have always thought that.\nWhat, uh, what uh, Nick, Nick Miller.\nSo you a, uh? You're a - What is that? - That's, that's his laugh.\nHe's never done that.\nThat's his laugh.\nDo you like my costume? I'm a public serpent.\nUm, I thought you weren't coming.\nOh, I changed my mind.\nYou know, I reread a few of Keaton's e-mails.\nHe can be quite cryptic.\nI think what he meant when he said that life was meaningful was really, \"Go to the party.\n\" - I'm pretty sure he didn't mean that.\nI know Keaton best.\nHey, Winston, by the way, great costume.\nMaya Angelou.\nCrap.\nWhat am I gonna do? Cece's on her way.\nSchmidt is rereading e-mails.\nDo you know what happens after rereading? Figuring it out.\nIt's The Truman Show.\nTruman Show, man, I love that movie.\nI'm not convinced you've ever seen it.\nI have; it's about the Civil War.\nBatcave? - Go, go, go, go, go.\nGo, go, go.\nWinston, go to Cece's and stall.\nOkay, fine.\nBut I got to hit the little King of the Late Night Talk Show's room first.\nMaybe slow down on that.\nYou're not great with booze.\nHey, I got it, I got it.\nYou got it? Good.\nUm, \"You're in grave danger.\nLeave where you are immediately.\n\" - Send.\nOkay.\nDon't! - You just sent that? - Yeah.\nA team has to talk about a decision before you hit send.\nSorry.\nI thought it was a really good move.\nTrick or treat.\nShh.\nAll right, you got to fix this.\nI'll meet you at your building in 30 minutes.\nTerrible! Send.\nNo! - What? Now what are we gonna do? - You told him Keaton was coming here? - No, Nick.\nAre you out of your mind? - It's a stall! It's a stall Until we can come up with a better plan.\nWell, who the hell is that? - I don't know.\nTrick or treat! You.\nI don't get what you're doing! Are you drunk? A little.\nWhat's your endgame here? - It's Halloween night.\nThis is the night when anyone can dress up in a costume and be anybody that they want.\nWould you listen to your woman voice for one second? Oh, you think I'm gonna talk to him in a woman voice when I'm talking to him? No, I have a character.\nYou're doing a character? Well, I'd love to hear it.\nI'm the Batman.\nOh.\nRight? So good.\nWhat, am I in the movie theater, eating popcorn? Jess, you're also five, four.\nKeep going further away.\nThe further you're away, the bigger you look.\nI would say run a little bit.\nNick!

Yes, but that one I feel like I shouldn't have had to.\nThey're unbelevably comfortable.\nWhat about that time that we saw Michael Keaton at that deli, and he stopped, and he winked?

No, I never said that.\nI'm just talking terminology.\nWe've never had the terminology.\nWe've never had the terminology.\nWhat? We've never used the terminology.\nIt's funny you act like you're my boyfriend, you have all the \"privileges\" of being my boyfriend.\nI enjoy them.\nWould like me to revoke those privileges?

All right, fellas! All right, he's back! So I got dancers for each of us, plus one floater to play the zone.\nOh, defense! - Yeah! - Here's a crazy idea.\nShoot, man.\nWhat if we got out of here, went back to the loft and just hung out? You're going through a big breakup.\nLet's talk it out, man.\nYeah, yeah, let's just, um, go home and talk feelings.\nNo.\nMm-mm.\nI was with Malia, now I'm not.\nThere, we talked about it.\nOh, look at the time.\nIt's butt o'clock.\nYou whipped.\nShut up, Schmidt.\nYou whipped.\nStraight-up whipped.\nI'm not whipped.\nWhipped like cream cheese.\nYeah, you are.\nWhipped like cream cheese.\nWhipped!

Oh, looks like you could use a new drink.\nBarkeep, can I please get a Shirley Temple with a finger of coconut rum and a lemon squeeze?

No.\nBecause he is a man.\nYou can't trust them, Jess.\nOkay? The moment you let your guard down, they just walk all over you.\nTonight is the night to beat them at their own game.\nHey, Artie! Bet you can't lift me! Uh, all sales of Bunny Money are final.\nHow am I supposed to spend $2,000 on dancers?

Oh, it's just one coffee shop.\nWouldn't you like to know? All right, guys, give it up for Candy! Is that lobster gray? Most expensive thing on the menu.\nI got to go.\nWhat?

We can see each other tomorrow.\nI didn't break up with Malia, all right? - She broke up with me.\nWhy didn't you say anything, man?

Uh-huh, that's where he works.\nYou want to drunk fight a cop? He stole my girlfriend.\nDid you hear the joke about the two black guys and two white guys who walked into a police station? - The two white guys came out.\nI'm with Winston.\nWinston? - Mm-hmm?

No, no.\nNick couldn't call me his girlfriend, and that hurt.\nNow I want to hurt him back with some long, hot conversation.\nThat's what you really want to do? - Yes.\nMen suck, remember? I'm sorry about saying that, because I put that on you, all right? That's because I'm going through something right now with Schmidt.\nYou have Nick.\nNick's a child who drinks on Tuesdays.\nYou're drinking on a Tuesday and you are a teacher.\nThose kids are watching a movie tomorrow.\nLook, Nick doesn't have a life plan.\nHe doesn't have a day plan.\nI once found a note he wrote to himself that said \"Put on pants\" followed by a question mark.\nThat means it read, \"Put on pants?\" Also, he throws pizza at seagulls, which I guess is kind of nice because he's trying to feed them.\nAnd he's a really, really great kisser.\nYou have something really good.\nJust go get Artie and tell him to leave, all right? Can you just get Derek?! Hey! Hey! He's gonna get the whole precinct!

I want to talk to you about your fitness level.\nOf what? My body? - When's the last time you worked out? You know what? I'll tell you when the last time he worked out was.\nIt was the time that he battled his daddy's other dumb sperm in order to make his way to his mama's dumb-ass egg.\nYour burns are getting better, man.\nJust really long.\nOkay.\nLook, I don't need to work out.\nI'm old-fashioned, Coney Island fat-strong.\nAh, Nicholas.\nChinese food for breakfast.\nSee you're still a health nut.\nAren't you supposed to be at work? - I'm rocking a PD personal day.\nYeah, last day of the move.\nCoach, I see you've wasted no time moving into my old room.\nAnyway, I just came over to, uh, drop off my old key.\nWow, so this is like a moment.\nLooking to get some much-needed space from this place.\nYou're right across the hall.\nThat's true.\nEverywhere you go There you are.\nWhat? - COACH: What? - His jeans are so small.\nNICK: He looks like a little puppet.\nLike something some Italian whittled.\nCome on, man, just let me train you.\nYou know what, Nick? You should do it.\nI would love for Coach to train me, but I kind of pushed it too hard at the court yesterday.\nWent in for a dunk.\nLanded sort of funny.\n(yells) Typical Winston.\n(laughing) - That's true.\nWhat is that supposed to mean? Because you're always too injured to play.\nRemember when you sat out of the game because you were sad? I was also cold.\nNick.\nLet's do this.\nLook at me.\nNow, you're in a new relationship, which puts you at risk for gaining the boyfriend 15.\nThat's not a thing.\nIt is a thing.\nJess is into this.\nI've seen this happen a million times.\nThe boyfriend 15 quickly turns into the boyfriend 20.\nNext thing you know, you're a fat dude on a little bike with a cowboy hat on talking about, \"My ass hurts.\n\" - I don't want to be that.\nI don't want you to be that.\nI would just be riding around in circles or would I be going places? Circles, dude.\nFat-guy rash on your arm.\nOkay, look, Schmidt's tried to get me to work out for years.\nIt didn't take.\nAlso, and it's not an excuse, I have a very bad back.\nYour bad back? - Yeah.\nYou gave me a piggyback ride two days ago and you giggled the whole time.\nIt was awesome.\nIt was also really funny.\nThat was pretty funny.\nWe took the stairs, dude.\nYeah.\nIt's 'cause I was excited.\nNick.\nEither take this dumpling and be a dumpling guy, or you train with me, and be a do-ing guy.\nIt's hard because I've been a dumpling guy my whole life I know.\nOne day, that's all I need.\nAnd I will change your life.\nYou'll be able to see your abs.\nI thought God just didn't give me those.\nCome on.\nLet's do it.\nMy man! - I'm in!

This is like Why do we need more menus? - Don't we have enough menus? - Feels like you're saying menus a lot.\nThis is an eco-disaster.\nConservation deserves a win today.\nHop Foo's has killed its last tree.\nJess, this feels like a something-else-is-going-on type of thing.\nAre you okay to drive? You got crazy eye! Uh, welcome to Hop Foo's.\nCan I help you? This morning, there were nine menus just in my apartment.\nI also hate those menus, they're so bad for the environment.\nIt's wasteful.\nIt's an eco-disaster.\nI'll talk to my boss, see if we can change that.\nYeah, great, you do that.\nI'm gonna follow up with you on that.\nI compost, recycle, but it's I don't feel like it's enough.\nThank you.\nGeez, thank you so much for stepping up and saying something.\nThat's who I am, that's just, you know, I'm - My name's Brian.\nJess.\nJessica.\nJess.\nIt's really refreshing to meet someone who actually cares.\nWell, it helps that you're gorgeous.\nHa!

Damn it, Coach.\nNick! I want you to really think about your next step.\nWhy do you care so much? - This is a crucial moment, a crossroads.\nBy you eating that, you are telling me that you'd rather sit on the couch eating dumplings than do something with your life.\nNow, are you a doer or a dumpling-er? I'm sorry, I'm not you, man.\nI'm a dumpling-er.\nMmm.\nOh, it's veggie.\nI did all that for nothing? I tried.\nWhere are you taking me? - What? You're my smoking gun.\nWinston's in a wheelchair?

From the movie Ghostbusters.\nOh, it says it with words an it says it with the Ghostbusters thing.\nAll right, just calm down.\nNo, here's what's going to happen.\nYou're going to stop putting these menus everywhere, or I'm going to show the people in here what happens when you eat the food.\nI actually like the food.\nListen, Jess, Chinese food is MSG.\nAmerica is living a lie, and we distribute menus so people order the food.\nJust accept that that's the way things are! No, I am done accepting things the way they are, because there are menus everywhere, and there are kids who want to see the ocean.\nWhat? - And I don't like your vibe, dude.\n(groans) Hey! This is what eating here did to my friend.\nIs that crispy noodles? (Coach singing) Coach.\nOh, no, no.\nWhat the hell are you doing, man? - I'm making island beats.\nI think this is what I'm gonna do from now on, since, obviously, I can't coach.\nI thought we were just messing around.\nWhy are you taking this so hard? Because, dude, I was trying to prove to myself that I could still do this.\nEver since Malia broke up with me I don't know I've just been a mess.\nFeel like I can't do anything right.\n(sighs) Guys, it's locked, it's unlocked.\nGet it together for real.\nWhat are you doing here? I thought you said you were so busy.\nI found this extra alarm clock, and, uh, I thought it'd be neighborly, so I'll set it up for you guys.\nYou're welcome.\nWait a second.\nWhat is that? - What's what? - Is that a camera? - Hmm? Schmidt, are you spying on us? So (scoffs) It is it's a camera.\nWell, I'm shocked.\nSchmidt, look, you decided to move out.\nSo move out.\nI am out.\nI'm actually very busy, you know that?

(sobs) Does anyone have an antihistamine? You know, I just moved across the hall, but it feels like I moved across an entire ocean.\nPeople grow up, especially young people.\nSo my friends don't even miss me anymore? Uh-huh.\nWell, they don't miss you.\nThey've moved on.\nWhat? Well, how do you know that? Because he told me.\nHis name is Conner, and he went to SUNY Binghamton.\nI once lived with 40 birds, and they all flew away, and I moved on.\nSlow down on the noodles, buddy.\nWell, congratulations, Miller.\nYou were right.\nWhat happened? - I terrorized a restaurant.\nI got a good man fired.\nI might have ran over a lizard with my wheelchair, but I am ashamed of it.\nSo, that's what you get for trying.\nLet's see what the enemy tastes like.\nIt's good.\nAnybody want to help me use the bathroom? - No.\nNo.\nOkay, I'll work it out.\nI shouldn't have even tried.\nYou just get hurt.\nCOACH: This is such a relief.\nI can get fat now.\nHey, guys, stop it! - I want to eat this all day.\nLike a Chinese food m\u00c3\u00a9nage.\nOh!

You just need some more clients.\nI believe in you.\nThanks.\nJess, you're awesome.\nYou are the most resourceful, optimistic, amazing person I've ever met in my life.\nI can't even get my kids on a field trip.\nYou can do anything you put your mind to 'cause you're smart, okay? Why can't you get 'em on this field trip? There's no way to get them to the beach.\nThat's a board.\nKarate-kick it! You're not used to making speeches, are you? Point of it is, is you never give up.\n(door slams shut) Fine.\nI guess you win.\nI sort of miss being here.\nWell, the nanny cam kind of gave it away.\nWell, nobody helped me, so now there is a real mess.\nHey, Winston, do you have some money where we could rent, like, a car or a bus or something? I found this wheelchair in a ditch.\nIs anyone gonna tell me anything that's going on? Stop! If it's not an idea about how to rent a car or a van, then I don't want to hear it! Wait a minute.\nNick? That's brilliant! JESS: Boys and girls, transportation provided by Hop Foo's restaurant.\nAll right, everybody, we did it! Ocean Conservation Day starts now! Welcome to the Pacific Ocean!

With his little trumpet, he's announcing the feast! It's so funny (laughing) (turkey gobbling) We should name that little guy Roger.\nWhen your testicles fell off, did you form lady parts, or is it kind of like a Gonzo nose down there? It's really interesting.\nYeah.\nYou see, the thing is, my testicles haven't fallen off Right.\nit's just the morning.\nAnd my testicles do this really unique thing of burrowing when it's cold out.\nYou're burning me.\nI gotta be real with you.\nPlease.\nI know how a guy can get, like, lost in a relationship.\nI've been there, dude.\nYou're snuggling, you're snuggling, you're snuggling, and then, bam! Next thing you know, you're wearing a jean skirt and a tube top with no panties on, because you guys said you were gonna dress up like each other for Halloween.\nBut she doesn't dress up like you.\nBut you still go to the party.\nI could not be more sorry for you, but that's not my story.\nStand up.\nStand up? Yeah.\nOkay.\nAre those Jessica's pajama bottoms? It's, uh football player pants for, uh, br-breast cancer awareness.\nI like the way that they hug my gronk.\nWho's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.\nJESS: Camping on Thanksgiving? It might be a crazy Nick idea, but I kind of like it.\nI thought you hated camping and nature.\nYou said you were afraid a fly was gonna fly in your head and learn all your thoughts.\nI am a man, and men belong in wilderness.\nIt really means a lot to me.\nThe only thing I care about is that we're all together.\nAnd that we can all sit down together and have a nice dinner.\nI 100% agree.\nI think everybody's gonna love this idea.\nMe, too.\nCamping? - Like we're animals? - What the hell? Come on.\nHear him out.\nLet's face it.\nOur indoor Thanksgivings haven't been so great.\nTurkey! Dead body! I think I'm into your mother.\nSo this can't be worse.\nThank you, Jessica, I got it from here.\nAll right.\nThis Thanksgiving, I want to honor the traditions of our forefathers.\nThe mighty Pilgrims and Native Americans who came together in order to survive.\nSure, yeah.\nThe first chapter in a proud history of cooperation.\nIt'll be the ultimate test of manhood and our survival skills.\nIt will? - WINSTON: How's this for a test of our manhood? We stay at home, we drink beer, we watch football.\nManhood.\nI like that idea.\nWinston, I'm talking about real men.\nMe, too.\nMen who fend for themselves.\nYou're the laziest man I know.\nOkay, Jess, be honest with me.\nHas he ever been on top? Real men are on the bottom.\nNo, they're not.\n(laughing) - You're on the bottom - Guys, guys.\nIt's Thanksgiving.\nWe need to be together.\nWho's in? Come on, guys! - All right, I'm in.\nWhat? - Yeah, Schmidt! - Yes! Look, my parents were super divorced and they never took me camping, but I always thought that I'd be incredible at it.\nLet's get ready.\nWINSTON: What the hell is on your head, Schmidt? SCHMIDT: It's an exact replica of the hat.\nViggo Mortensen wore in Hidalgo.\nKnew you'd like it.\n(Jess chuckles) JESS: Wow! Nice job, Miller! This spot's beautiful.\nNICK: I know.\nCece! - Cece's here? I didn't know she was gonna be here.\nYay, I'm so happy you came! (laughs) We're all together! - It makes me so excited.\nOf course! I mean, what could be better than camping in the woods with my ex-boyfriend and his friend I just made out with.\nWith whom you just made out.\nDon't.\nIt's very important.\nYou know I hate that.\nDon't.\nGrammar's important.\nSeriously, don't.\nIf it get awkward, I'll come save you.\nHappy Thanksgiving! JESS: Yay! (chuckles) Hey, what's up, girl? Hey, Cece.\n(clears throat) Hey, I never, uh had a chance to ask you.\nHow did the, um How'd your guys' date go the other night? - Oh, with Cece? - Yeah.\nUh it was I loved it.\nI mean, it was good.\nIt was cool.\nThat's great.\nSuper.\nSuper-duper.\nSo where you thinking - about pitching, uh, pitching a tent? - Thinking over there.\nOh, yonder? - Yeah, sure.\nYeah.\nYonder.\nListen, I've been researching on the Internet for the past 12 hours everything there is to know about the wood.\nNow I'm a I'm a master camper.\nSo if you need any help with anything, just come to me and ask, okay? (chuckling): Thanks, man.\nI don't know anything about the wood.\nI know everything.\nI'm lost.\nWhat is that, a tree? If these trees were skyscrapers, - you'd feel very comfortable.\nYeah.\nI'd be right at home.\nUnfortunately, - they're actual trees.\n(chuckling): Yeah.\nYou're the best.\nI love the hat! I'm sorry, is that a solar cell phone charger? Yeah, I can't go more than two days without it.\n(quietly): Okay, hold on.\nDo you do you hate camping, too? Are you kidding me? I absolutely hate camping.\nThen why are we here? Because I didn't get a say.\nI never get a say.\nWhenever I want to do something, they don't give a hoot.\nGuess who just got free passes to a pottery seminar.\nGet out of here.\nWinston! We could've made the craziest mugs, man.\n(grunts) - Hey, Nick? - Yeah.\nThere's just beer in here.\nThat should last us for the first few hours, - actually.\nWhere's the food? Where-where are all the pies I made? Look, don't worry, Jess.\n'Cause the food is right here.\nI'm sorry.\nI don't understand that gesture.\nWe're gonna be hunting and foraging for our dinner, just like the Indians and the Pilgrims.\nBut you brought beer.\nYou can't forage for beer.\nAnd that's a necessity.\nSo this is Thanksgiving meal? We can do this.\nGuys, we've gotten soft! With our antibiotics and our sports creams.\nDo you think George Washington had a pet cat? Yeah.\nNo.\nHe didn't.\nHe hunted them.\nWhat? And he made milk and butter out of their spoils.\nThat's terrible.\nSo you're saying George Washington milked his cat? Nothing is sounding accurate right now.\nNot at all.\nWhere'd you read this? I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.\nIt's gonna be hard.\nBut we will emerge out of this better friends and a tribe.\nI'm on board.\n(chuckles) Going old-school.\nMen! Killing! Hunting! Men! SCHMIDT, COACH and NICK: Men! Men! Men! Men! Oh, my cowman's my cowman my cowman's hat, my cowman's hat.\nWINSTON: Guys, look, I'm as much a man as anybody here, but this plan is straight-up dookie.\nI need my sweets and I need my parade.\nYeah, you know what? I'm out, too.\nGuys, guys, guys.\nLook.\nWe're together.\nWe're a family.\nIt's Thanksgiving.\nAnd I'm sure Nick has a plan.\nRight? - Oh, yeah.\nI've got a plan.\nGreat.\nYou got a plan? - The man's got a plan.\nThese wilderness guides right here detail what plants are safe for eating and what traps we can build.\nUnfortunately, I ran out of money, so I couldn't print out the chapters on gutting and skinning, but we'll worry about that when we get there.\nPilgrim rules.\nMen, hunters! Women, foragers.\nI'm not hunting.\nThe only Hunt I want is Bonnie or Helen.\nYou know what I'm talking about, Coach.\nWhat? Nick.\nThis is perfect.\nPrimal man in nature.\nStalking prey.\nWho's basically the lady now, Coach? I've seen that tree six times in the past 20 minutes.\nWe're definitely moving in a small circle.\nNICK: Here's what I'm gonna do.\nI'm gonna clear a path this way.\nWe will travel northbound, I believe.\nThat's not north; that's south.\nThat is south? Then let's travel southbound.\nI'm gonna clear a path.\nIf something's in there and you get injured, I promise you I will kill you fast.\n(groans) Scat! Scat.\nThere's an animal nearby.\nHey, Schmidt, that's a raisin, man.\nThat's not a raisin.\nThis is scat.\nOkay.\n(coughs) (clears throat) That's poop for sure.\nI was right.\nIn your face, Nick.\nIn your face, Nick.\nHow so? I don't know, he put a put a turd in his mouth.\nAnd that's in my face? - Yeah.\nI don't think we should start eating poo yet, Schmidt.\nLet's wait on that.\nYou want to chase that with some dirt? Does anyone have any gum? No.\nNot that I wanted any in the first place.\nThat's a mighty big hole there, Nick.\nYou trying to catch a refrigerator? It's a bear hole.\nBear falls in, other stuff falls in.\nWe take what the bear doesn't want.\nMakes sense.\nClassic human/bear team-up.\nI'm from Chicago.\nIt's the best I can do.\nYeah, bears love to share.\nWhat are you planning on doing with that bear when he falls into the hole? Dude, I'm trying the best that I can! We have no food.\nLet me explain something to you, Nick.\nWhen you're building a trap, you want to customize it to your prey.\nSo, I don't know, if was trying to catch, say a squirrel, I'd want think like a squirrel.\nAllow me to demonstrate with this trap that I built.\nHow do you get into the mindset of a squirrel? (clicking tongue) I'm a squirrel right? You do that really well.\nLook at this! Oh, there's some nuts here.\nLook at all these little nuts.\nYou might not want to do that.\nIf I needed your advice on how to lead a spinning class, I'd ask you, but this is my territory.\n(Schmidt yells) - My scapula! - Dude, are you all right? Aah! Aah, get it off! Aah! (Schmidt groaning) Get it! Get up.\nKeep breathing, man.\nI don't mean to be laughing, but are you okay? I'm gonna make you a sling.\nYou're gonna make me a what? You don't know how to do that.\nA sling.\nOf course I do.\nWhat? - What are you doing? - I was an Eagle Scout.\nWhat are you talking about, you were an Eagle Scout? - Look.\nThat's actually really good.\nI'm sorry, dude.\nYou wanted to be the best at camping.\nYou were so excited about your hat.\nI didn't want to get in the way of that.\nPlus with the whole Cece thing or whatever.\nWhat are talking about? You're gonna let me be the best camper.\nI am the best camper! Yeah.\nI think this is chicory.\nIt says you can eat the root.\nOr it's jasmine.\nWhich will kill you.\nHmm.\nWhat do you guys think?\nI'm sure it's fine.\nYeah, just eat it.\n\n\n\nHey, raspberries! There Ow! (laughs): Ow.\nThere are a lot of brambles in here.\nThere's a country store not far from here.\nOw! Three and a half stars.\nThe reviews say, \"It's functional and dusty.\n\" - Ow! - Sounds good to me.\nThis is so fun.\nWho wants to help? This plan is officially the worst.\nWe are starving.\nJust admit, you don't want to do this, either.\nOkay, listen up.\nOnly stuff we can find in the forest, right? Look at that fish.\nIt's perfect.\nWhat? Oh, I'm gonna grab it.\nI'm so hungry.\nNow we get to eat, boys.\nDude, that looks dead.\nGuys, stop being negative right now.\nLaying on its side means it's dead.\nI wouldn't get in that water, man.\nYou're gonna get beaver fever.\nWhere are my testicles now, Coach? When he catches that little critter, I'm gonna show you how to scale it.\nOw.\nThat hurts? Yeah, it hurts! A boulder fell on my Is all this 'cause I teased you about the invite? Yes, it is! No regrets! (grunts) Aw! Aw, come on, Nick.\n(yells) NICK: Yes! Quit it.\nYou guys might be right! It might be dead! In fact, it was dead! Smells fresh enough! Oh, come on, Winston, what? You just get your nails done? Get the apple dirty! Grind some dirt in it, grind some dirt in it.\nGod, I'm so hungry! Hey, hey! Hey.\nLook what the men brought.\nOh, hey! Hey, hey! The plan worked.\nHey, he looks like a fighter.\nHe really was, kind of.\nOh, my God! - Wow.\nI mean, well Whoa.\nLike a smorgasbord.\nYou guys did great.\nYeah, we did.\nYep.\nWhere'd you get the cashews? - Um, on a bush.\nYeah.\nHow about the beets? - Also a bush.\nThat's right.\nYeah.\nThe avocado? - Also on a bush.\nThat's right.\nWell, look at us.\nLiving off the land, fending for ourselves.\nWe got fish and fruits, and this is probably gonna be the most delicious apple I've ever eaten in my life.\n\"Product of Oregon\"? We walked to Oregon? - What? - What? That's why this cramp Yeah This place Come on, you think the three of us are true dumb-asses? We're not.\nI kind of knew from the beginning.\nI mean, there's no way.\nYou just went to a store and got all this? I think so.\nI think they definitely bought everything from the store.\nThe one thing I wanted was for us all to sit down together and have dinner, and you can't do that without dinner.\nWe have dinner.\nThat fish kind of looks like hippo meat.\nCome on, man.\nLet's just sit down and eat some delicious almonds.\nAnd enjoy ourselves.\nYes.\nAnd have a really nice Thanksgiving together.\nCome on, Nick, let's eat.\nCome on, man, let's eat.\nI feel like how they must've felt on the first Thanksgiving.\nBetrayed.\nWhat? Happy Thanksgiving.\nOh, come on.\nNick, come on! - Don't do this.\nFYI, the first Thanksgiving was the good one.\nWINSTON: Come on, Nick! These avocados were expensive! Here we go.\nIt smells so good.\nI can't wait till it's ready.\nI'm gonna be so stuffed.\nOoh! The eyeball fell off.\nThat's how you know it's good.\nThey got to pop out when it's ready, I think.\nNow that the cards are finally on the table, I guess we can see who the true camp master really is.\nThe answer's me.\nFirst one to make a flame wins.\nLet's do this.\nNow, check this out.\nThis is how you make a flame.\nYou go with two rocks.\nOne against the other.\nYou create friction.\nI'm done.\nWhat?

You bring the check to me.\nNo arguments, moon man.\nCECE: Oh, my God! Is anyone hurt? We're fine.\nI may have cracked a few ribs, and, uh, Jess is delirious.\nI think she thinks she's a rabbit.\nGuys, we're gonna figure something out, all right? NICK: Just get us a rope or a stick or something.\nAll right, man, so, any ideas? What are you talk? You know what, Coach? Don't humor me.\nWhat? - You know what to do.\nLook, I admit it.\nYou're a better camper than I am.\nYou're better at life than I am.\nYou're probably better at dating Cece than I am.\nI saw you guys the other night inhaling each other in front of the loft.\nSchmidt, that's all we did.\nThat was it.\nI asked her to come upstairs, she said no, okay? And now she won't return any of my text messages.\nShe's been ignoring me this whole trip.\nI'm all, like, \"Hey.\n\" She's like, \"Mm-hmm.\n\" I'm like, \"What?\" Why are you smiling, dude? I'm not smiling.\nI'm over here baring my soul to you, dude, and you're freaking smiling in my face.\nYeah.\nThis is the face I make when I listen.\nAll your teeth show when you listen? I'm not.\nYou're smiling right now.\nI opened up to you.\nYou're pissing me off.\nStop smiling.\nI'm not.\nI will wreck you.\nYou're crazy, man.\nYou're nuts.\nStop it, listen to me.\nWe are going to solve this right now.\nAll right, take your pants off.\nOkay, I am no Eagle Scout, but I know how to make a pants rope.\nPants rope.\nYou're a genius.\nI know.\nOkay.\nAre you gonna take off your pants? Yeah, right after I take off my bra so we can anchor the rope to the tree.\nThat's gonna happen for real? - Just take them off now.\n(laughing): Whoa, look at Winston's pants.\nIt's got kittens on it.\nThese aren't kittens.\nI cannot believe I'm here voluntarily.\nSo stupid.\nTake them off.\nThey're coming off.\nCECE: Here, you guys, grab hold of the rope.\nOkay, you go first, Jess.\nI'll be right behind you to support you.\nDing, dong, ding, dong! - What are you doing? Okay, how about this? Get on my back, I'll bring us both up.\nBack at you.\nWhoa.\n(coughs) You can do it! There, hold this flashlight, buddy.\nGrab hold.\n(blows raspberry) - Come on, Nick! Come on.\nHere we go! Oh, God, I'm gonna get you out of here.\n(straining) Use your legs, Nick.\n(grunting) Come on, Nick!

Yeah! - Yeah.\nYeah.\nALL: Oh! Hey.\nThanks for saving me, mountain man.\nSo I've got good news from the doctor: you don't have rabies.\nOh.\nYou have, uh, giardia and something called Legionnaires' disease.\nI'm just glad they were able to save your foot.\nWhat? No, nothing.\nNever mind.\n(chuckles) Hey, I'm sorry about the whole camping thing.\nOh, no, it's okay.\nAh, I was really stupid.\nI haven't been myself.\nYou're the man I want.\nAll you wanted was for everyone to be together on Thanksgiving, Jess.\nNext year.\nPotato chips.\nChips? Maybe a treat.\nListen, Coach, uh, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I thought maybe that I could give you some advice about about Cece.\nHow desperate do you think I am? I think you're probably very desperate.\nI'm very desperate, I mean, she's giving me nothing.\nTold her she looked pretty, she said thanks.\nMm-hmm.\nWhat kind of mind game is that? Look, Coach, things have always come easy to you.\nCece is not going to be one of those things.\nI once spent hours in a car with just a cracked window for air.\nShe was going into a club and she just kind of left me there.\nWhy are you smiling about that? Hey, guys, I figured out a way to save Thanksgiving.\nI got a plan.\nSCHMIDT: Enough with the plans.\nYou suck at plans! Not another Nick Miller plan.\nI love you, man, but you are terrible at plans.\nHey.\nIt's still 11:48, so happy Thanksgiving.\nWhat? Got us some Brazilian nuts, a couple of string cheeses, and.\nSnack.\nThank you.\nWINSTON: I got the parade on my phone.\nYes.\nMade some decorations.\nI think this may be a turkey sandwich, but I'm not sure, and I know this whole thing isn't It's perfect.\nLook, guys, start without me because it might be a few weeks before I can eat again.\n(all laughing) You were throwing up a lot.\n(laughs) That was scary seriously.\nOkay, I'm starving actually.\nLet's eat.\nYeah, let's eat.\nNick found all this food in the woods.\n(all laughing) Can I have the ginger ale? Yeah, Nick found that.\nIt's already open.\n"}, {"title": "03x11 - Clavado En Un Bar.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWell, nothing brightens up a rainy day like a Scotch tasting, guys.\nIt's not raining today.\nIt hasn't rained in months.\nShh, don't ruin the moment.\nThere's actually a huge forest fire.\nDude, you should turn on the news.\nThis is a 15-year-old French oak reserve.\nMm!

That is $45 worth of Scotch right there.\nIt tastes disgusting.\nI don't like it.\nWho's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.\nSo, obviously, Nick has told you about how I've been volunteering at the Children's Museum, and really hitting it off with the head curator, Candace, right? In my way, I have.\nI've never heard that.\nHasn't said a word.\nThank God.\nCome on.\nGuys, give me one second.\nI gotta go play a round of \"Car Keys Monte\" with Kevin-97 or he'll try to drive home.\nSo, anyway, about a month ago, Candace calls me and tells me there might be a full-time fund-raising position opening up - and I'd be perfect for it.\nThere we go, look for the keys, look for the keys, look for the keys.\nAnd she keeps pushing me for an answer, and I keep putting her off.\nI say, \"Thank you very much.\nI'm very flattered, but I already have a job.\nMe teacher.\n\" That's a grammar joke.\nYou get it.\nLook at the jukebox for a sec.\nWhen I think of teachers, I think of two things: Jessica Day and pornography where the characters are teachers.\nWell, of course I've always wanted to be a teacher, but my school's a disaster.\nJustice Brandeis believed that Ms.\nDay? Education's Principal Foster, everybody! Thank you so much.\nMs.\nDay, we have hit a construction hiccup - in our renovation, so - Okay.\neverybody's gonna have to be sharing classroom space.\nWhat? - Oh.\nHey, do you have a freezer or should I flush these frogs? My check comes either way.\nOh, come on.\nFoster's sticking us with the math kids that use letters instead of numbers? Do you mean algebra? I guess.\nAnyway, it's gonna be a couple of crazy months, huh? I'm sorry? Months? Right.\nYears if the bond issue fails.\nWhich it might, since voters are trending anti-future.\nAnti-future? Who's anti-future? I don't know.\nThe Amish? The dying? Television industry, print media, record industry, railroad industry, karaoke machine owners.\nYou got this? I'm gonna go not smoke pot.\nSo my phone rings - Oh, we telling phone stories? Nice.\nNo, I'm talking about work.\nSo your phone rings.\nAnd it's Candace officially offering me the job! And I told her I'd think about it! Wow, you not being a school teacher? Well, you have found my flabbergast button, and guess what, you've pressed it.\nI'm flabbergasted as hell, too.\nLook, I've been a teacher my entire life, and I've always wanted to be a teacher, but maybe I should be doing something else.\nI don't know.\nHow do you know when you're on the right path? It's crazy.\nThat wasn't a rhetorical question.\nOh! - Oh! What I like to do is just take a drive up PCH maybe.\nWilly Wonka once said Guys, Candace is calling at 6:00 to find out my final answer! - Whoa! - What? I'm sorry you're in such a pickle.\nBut I'm not sorry that I get to time something! - All right.\nJust to be clear, 19 minutes until 6:00.\nI'm not sure this is helping.\nThis brings a whole new level of tension to the whole situation.\nYeah, because you're being timed now.\nYou time a lot of stuff, Coach.\n46 seconds.\nThis is a life-changing decision, that's it.\nCoach, do you always wear a stopwatch? Like always? You familiar with Rollergirl's relationship to her skates in Boogie Nights? - Yes.\nWell, I'm not, because I don't watch movies, I time them.\nThey're pornographers, but they're also a family.\nmy round ass! Jess, choosing a career path is never easy, but what I found - Oh, my God.\nShut up, dude! She's looking for career advice.\nYour job could be done by a vending machine.\nGuys, don't be mean.\nSo Nick doesn't have a traditional career.\nI mean Or is it the most traditional? Maybe I'm thinking about prostitution.\nGuys, as you all know, I am the expert at changing career paths.\nIs this something we're now bragging about? No, Schmidt, I'm referring to my decision to quit playing the game of basketball.\nJess, I will tell you this, it was not easy.\nIt all began back Come on, Winston move it along.\nOkay, Jess, fine, but don't blame me if you get lost in the nooks and crannies of this crazy English muffin we call Winston's life.\nI was the ninth guy off the bench for the eighth-best team in Latvia.\nWinnie the Bish! Winnie the Bish! Winnie the Bish! Ha-ha! Thanks for coming to watch me play, guys.\nWe didn't watch you play.\nWe watched you sit.\nWhich was still fun.\nYou know, any chance to get to Latvia, right, guys? Yeah, I haven't played all year.\nThey barely let me practice, but you know, like I always say, How about them Lats? So that's when you decided to change course.\nThat makes sense.\nSo my takeaway from that is Still building to the decision.\nYou are traded to Kraslava City.\nThe Outdoor League? Man, they play on a hillside! I give you surprise tip: Uphill basket, better.\nAha, and then you decided Ah! I'm going fast! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You never play basketball again.\nDon't touch it.\nStop it.\nAnd that's when I decided to stop playing the game of basketball.\nJess, walk away the moment you stop loving it.\nI mean, that's what I did.\nThat's the thing, you didn't walk away.\nYou decided nothing.\nThat story contains zero decisions.\nLook, I decided to stop playing the game of basketball when my doctor told me I had to stop.\nOkay, okay, all right, I it was my decision Mm-hmm.\nto start to play the game of basket You were handed a basketball six seconds after you were born.\nDamn, do I even like basketball? I mean, goodness, have I ever made any decisions my whole life? Are we all just living inside the mind of a giant? All right, good job, buddy.\nReally good.\nThanks.\nYou know, if I may be so bold Oh, Nick, please.\nWinston, have a seat.\nI was literally about to give advice.\nShe already heard one cautionary tale tonight, she does not need to hear another.\nWhat she needs to hear is my story.\nAll right.\nA story of hard choices.\nA story of paths taken.\nA story that I like to call, \"Kablamo McYeah, Bro!\" Ah, you stupid bast The title has nothing to do with the story, but you need a hook.\nIt all began back - Come on, Schmidt! What? Only one story in the whole wide world can begin in a hospital? I volunteered a lot in college.\nBut I shone brightest as a candy striper.\nSick people wanted me.\nDying people wanted to be me.\nI was the total candy-striping package.\nAnd yet I remained invisible to the one whose gaze I desired the most.\nInvisible? You were like a 300-pound wall of peppermint bark.\nHer badge said \"RN\" for registered nurse, but as far as I was concerned, it said \"NILTH,\" \"Nurse I'd Like To Hug.\n\" Not even the baggiest of scrubs could hide her splendid form.\nWhere's a guy have to volunteer to get a girl like that, huh? I don't volunteer.\nI'm a man.\nI have a job in marketing.\nObviously I was far too fat to work in marketing.\nSo I got a job any dumb slob could do.\nRelax, man, it's your first day.\nFor a Jewish giant, I had a surprising knack for selling Christmas trees.\nNot only did my wide center of gravity make me freakishly strong, but I could also sell like the wind.\nBecause I understood one fundamental truth.\nWhen you're buying Christmas trees you're really buying sex.\nHave you always been short? I've always been fat.\nBut who cares how God made you? Don't let him put you in a skin box.\nAt the end of the day, I'm just a fat guy standing here in front of a short guy telling him that I think we found his tree.\nIt wasn't long before I caught the attention of Old Man McCue, Christmas tree king of Syracuse, inventor of triple netting.\nHowever In the words of the late, great Sir Billy Joel Billy Joel is definitely alive.\nAnd he's definitely not a knight.\n\"The good, they do die young.\n\" As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left 'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long That even my mama thinks That my mind is gone, but When you're on your deathbed, when your life has been lived, you're never gonna say, \"I wish I'd spent more time with my family.\n\" Because money and everything it buys, you can take it with you Interesting, money.\nActually the museum job pays more than the teaching job.\nWait, the m Then what the hell are we talking about here, you guys? Done deal, case closed.\nFollow them ducats.\nIt's not always about the money, Schmidt.\nGuys, look, it's almost 6:00.\nAnd Candace is insanely punctual.\nYou know, one of the best career choices of the future Driveways.\nYou're welcome.\nJess, the museum job pays more.\nAll right - The decision has been made for you.\nNo, no, no.\nYou don't know the difference between more and less.\nDon't you? - Yes, Schmidt.\nAll of my decision's have been made for me.\nI'm only in sports radio because I played professional basketball.\nI played professional basketball because somebody put a ball in my crib as a baby.\nWhat if somebody gave Baby Winston a flower? Then what would I be? - Beekeeper! - Hummingbird farmer.\nOh, does water shoot out of the flower? If so, you'd be a hilarious comedian.\nWait, guys, this is classic after 6:00 topics.\nLook, I There has to be more to this than money.\nI really want to care about what I do.\nDon't you ever miss getting your hands dirty - and selling? - I've moved up in the world.\nI'm not freezing and covered in sap.\nI'm making spreadsheets.\nIt's like Old Man McCue used to say.\nThe reward is in the destination.\nIt's not in the journey.\nWas he wise or was he senile? Because he's mixed up a lot of really well-known sayings.\nJess, you're gonna want to listen to me.\nAnyone else here named after their career? People call you Markety? Not yet.\nThat's too bad 'cause that's awesome.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no! Hands up, Ulvis! Ball screen, Vlad, come on! There we go, yes! Bishop, finger out of your nose, now! Ernie's a really good coach.\nMaybe we should call him Coach.\nWe should probably call him You do it first.\nYeah.\n\n\n\nUh Coach.\nThat's a great name! High five! Yeah! I think you see what I mean.\nNo, I do I really don't.\nMy point is don't overthink it, Jess.\nThe call's coming from inside the house.\nWhat? Be who you are.\nAnd do what you do.\nWhat if I don't know who I am? And you know, I'm capable of doing a lot of different things.\nThen you are on your own.\nGood stuff, Coach.\nJess, would it help to think about your first day as a teacher? Like, I think about the first time I ever poured a drink - Boo, get off the stage! - Aw, man.\nNick! - Dude, stop.\nNo, that's interesting.\nThe first day I ever taught.\nPortland Country Day.\nFive-team Pacific Northwest squash champions.\nGo, Rhododendrons! Now, if I was chalk, where would I be? If I were chalk, where would I be? Slip up like that in front of the kids, Day, and they'll eat you alive.\nEddie Pascucci kicked my ass because I'm new.\nWell, guess what? I'm new, too.\nI got lost trying to find the upper dining garden.\nOh, that's over by the hedge maze and the stables.\nI haven't even met my horse yet.\nCome on, let's get you cleaned up.\nAll of these jackets have cash in the pockets.\nIt's like a $50,000 lost and found.\nHere, try this one.\nYup.\nYou look great, Clifton.\nThis doesn't fit! Eddie Pascucci beats up the unstylish! Yeah, that's right.\nWe had an ethnic, gay bully.\nHe's gonna have to come through me first.\nClifton Collins really just needed someone to believe in him.\nSo I started tong him in math, and he became the best math student in school.\nSo, let's look him up and see how happy and successful and amazing he's doing.\nYeah! - I think that'll really fire you up.\nAll right, there's no trace of him.\nWhat? - I'm really, I'm really good at this.\nI'm good at it, let me see.\nYou found him.\nHe's right here.\nNo, I didn't.\nHere's Clifton, wow.\nIt's not a - Yeah, he's right there.\nThat's Clifton.\nOh, yeah.\nWe're not the only ones looking for him.\nSo's the FBI.\nWhat? - Yeah, he's a criminal.\nNo.\nOh, my God.\nClifton \"Baby Madoff\" Collins? Wanted for 53 counts of embezzlement.\nSounds like the math took.\nScrew me.\nLike, I Maybe I wasn't even reaching the kids at all.\nOkay, you know what? - Miller up.\nExcuse me? That's just like \"fill 'er up,\" but with \"Miller.\n\" - Don't.\n'Cause I'm about to fill you up.\nNo, that's gross.\nWith my stories.\nOh, please don't.\nThat's disgusting.\nWhat's disgusting about it? My first year of law school, I made an important discovery.\nLook left.\nLook right.\nNext year, one of you will be gone.\nWhat a clich\u00c3\u00a9, huh? Oh, you wrote that down.\nYou'll be gone.\nI'm not going anywhere.\nI'm gonna be fine.\nI'm gonna be right here.\nTake it easy, guy to my right.\nI discovered that I hated being around these people.\nBut second year, I made another discovery.\nI hated being around myself.\nSo my third year, I wanted to find a place where I belonged.\nWhere I could look to my left or look to my right and like what I saw.\nLove you in that scarf.\nWhy don't you wear scarves anymore? That place? Perhaps you guessed it: This very bar.\nGet out of town.\nWhat a twist.\nHow long has that guy been there? Kevin-97? Since 1997, Jess.\nWhy else do you think we would call him I don't know.\nMove it along, Miller.\nTrue, I wasn't loving law school, but my grades were fine and I even signed up for the California State Bar.\nAnd then, one day Red over-served himself and everything changed.\nSo you went behind the bar, quit law school, you became a bartender - There's more to it than that.\nTwo minutes! Oh, my God.\nI honestly don't know what to do.\nI have so little time.\nHey.\nCece! Have you ever questioned your entire career? Duh, I'm a 31 year old model.\nMy last job was for a phone sex ad, and I was the one calling.\nTell me what to do.\nAnd don't tell me to ask the guys, because I already tried that.\nAnd also, don't tell me to think about my first student, Clifton.\nOkay, no, wait.\nYour first student was not Clifton.\nLady, she's still got one minute.\nThat was a butt dial from your mother.\nShe is up to no good.\nCece, bring it fast, and bring it hard.\nYou have 53 seconds.\nYou okay? Yes.\nNo.\nI think I need glasses unless crying makes your eyes not work.\nI can't read this, but even when I can, I don't understand it.\nCrying makes your eyes work better.\nAfter I finished Sophie's Choice, I could see in the dark for a week.\nHere's what I do when I lose mine.\nOoh, this is interesting.\nGet in here, we'll learn it together.\nBut everyone'll laugh at us.\nThey can drive it or milk it as far as I'm concerned.\nI don't know what that means.\nI heard my dad say it.\nMy dad just died.\nWell, if you want to come over, and listen to mine say \"They can drive it or milk it\" you can.\nHe's also got one about the turds in City Hall.\nThanks.\nI'm Cece.\nJess.\nI was your first student.\nHey, Candace.\nUm Yeah, actually I'm not gonna take the job.\nYeah, I'll see you Sunday.\nOkay, bye.\nYeah! - Whoo! - Thanks guys.\nYes! - Thanks guys.\nYou did it.\nGood stuff.\nHey, she did it.\nYou made the right call, Jess.\nWhat's wrong? I think you're right.\nI made the right decision.\nLook, I know it's hard, but the hard is what makes it good.\nUhm, A League of Their Own - Is that from A League of Their Own.\nYes, of course.\nAll of my quotes are from a sports movie.\nYou guys don't know them, and so they seem original.\nA League of Their Own is not a sports movie.\nIt's a sports movie, first and foremost.\nIt's about sisterhood and the war.\nYeah, absolutely.\nIt's about a baseball team grinding it up.\nThis used to be my playground Coming right up.\nHis sister really worries about his drinking, so what I do is I come in early, and I soak a teabag until the water turns brown and looks like booze.\nI call it tea-water.\nSo tea.\nI will take a big old glass of booze-water.\nGot an antacid commercial tomorrow - Oof.\nand I'm playing day-old curry.\nOr you can bartend.\nYou can bartend till you're 90 years old.\nWhy don't you fire this down to Kevin-97? Oh, no.\nWe're gonna work on that.\nGood morning, everybody.\nWelcome to Alge-Bio-Civics.\nTurn in your equations, and you will get a frog.\nDissect carefully, because inside the frog is the name of the city council member who you will be e-mailing to restart construction.\nMs.\nDay? - Yes.\nI thought this was gonna be a disaster.\nBut thanks to you, I can go upstairs to the big boys and tell them they can always depend on Dr.\nAlan Foster.\nYeah.\nPlease take his job, I'm begging you.\nI'd do it myself, but I'd never pass the psych test.\nSo I figure if Foster can be a principal, then why can't I be a principal? - That's great.\nI don't see why not.\nThank you.\nThen you could take me to the principal's office and punish me - for being tardy, and - You know we're right here, right? Just lift up my britches and - We'll talk about it later.\nOkay.\nVery nice.\nWe'll do it in my office.\nAfter I fill up my juice box.\nSo, guys, just quit my job today.\nWhoa, big decision.\nOh, man! - What?

I'm still working on it.\nShe's getting better.\nThat was great.\nThat was awesome.\nYeah.\nA natural.\nHey.\nHey.\nSorry I didn't let you finish your story.\nWhat's this? - The end of my story.\nNo way! You passed the bar exam? I wanted to prove to myself that I dropped out of law school because I wanted to be a bartender, not because I couldn't be a lawyer.\nThis also says \"spaghetti sandwich.\n\" - That's just 'cause it's a great idea.\nWhen I have a great idea, I write it down.\nThe point is is I want this.\nYou know, it makes me happy.\nWell, here.\nNow, can I get you a drink? - Sure.\nSure.\nCheers.\nTo unemployment.\nAbsolutely.\nExactly.\nI see you're looking at a Douglas fir.\nIt's a beautiful tree.\nWe move a ton of these Dougie firs.\nLove them.\nBut I feel like you're ready for the spruce lifestyle.\nLet's spruce this up.\nLet me put you in a spruce today.\nWhat kind of ceilings you dealing with at home?

Well, Coach 101 is, he's watching basketball.\nAnd that's all he's gonna do from October till June.\nHis team's the Pistons.\nI mean, they were great in the '80s, but then we got Jordan.\nThen they started getting good.\nThen we got Thibodeau.\nWhat you gonna do now? And he knows that.\nThat's genius.\nBasketball.\nThat's my way in.\nBasketball's not your in.\nYou don't know anything about basketball.\nCome on.\nYou refer to it as \"basketsball.\n\" Well, that's the technically-correct term, Nick.\nThere are two baskets.\nI'm an English teacher.\nBasketball's just the first step.\nWe sit down, we watch a game.\nWe have a few laughs.\nBefore you know it, we'll be digging into each other's pasts.\nThat's not how it works, though.\nChildhoods, Nick.\nThat's the friendship money shot.\nMen watch sports so we don't have to talk about childhood stuff.\nNo.\nIt's a real thing.\nAnd the game doesn't even have deeper meaning.\nCome on.\nAnd there's no layers to it.\nIf I'm talking about a player overcoming the defense to win, - that's not like I'm overcoming it.\nNo.\nCome on.\nNot only that.\nHe's a Pistons fan, and I'm a Bulls fan.\nRight.\nI don't understand, no.\nIt's rivalries.\nSharks and cats.\nYankees, Red Sox.\nWhales and dolphins.\nPistons fan, Bulls fan.\nEnd of discussion.\nI get it.\nJean Valjean and Javert.\nYeah, definitely.\nThis is like a Jean Vanjer and Vajer situation.\nSo, where do you do the marketing? - Oh, Winston, so sweet, so naive.\nWhere do we do the marketing? We do the marketing everywhere.\nNow, you're gonna want to take notes on everything I do, 'cause you're about to see life happen at the speed of business.\nSchmidt.\nI have a task for you.\nHi, Kim.\nWe got a new guy, and I want you to show him around.\nWait.\nWho's this? - Oh, I'm just shadowing Schmidt.\nCalled my bluff.\nDon't care - Ed? Come meet Schmidt.\nOkeydokey.\nThat's the new guy? \"New\" compared to what, the moon? Here's what happened.\nGwen turned 45, so we had to fire her.\nObviously.\nSo, wait.\nGwen's job is available? Yeah, but then grandma turned around and filed an ageism lawsuit, so we hired Bran Flakes here to cover our ass.\nJust do it.\nAll right, I'll do it.\nWell, here I am.\nOkay.\nI'm Schmidt.\nI guess they wanted you to learn from the best.\nWell, actually, they said your office was closest to the can.\nI got a prostate the size of an avacada.\n\"Closest to the can.\n\" - Do not write that down, Winston! Is it not closest to the can? Yes! Hey.\nWhoa.\nI stay sealed off during basketball season.\nPlus, I, uh, dropped some olives under the bed, can't reach 'em.\nOh.\nI got little pinchers.\nOkay.\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yoom.\nHey, so I was gonna watch the, uh, Pistons of Detroit game.\nDon't really have the reach for that.\nGood thing I got legs.\nWait.\nYou like the Pistons? - Oh, yeah.\nJust like you.\nAre you serious?! - Yeah, I'm dead serious.\nAw! - So, you in? - Be cool to watch it on a big TV.\nI found your olives.\nOh, you did? - Thought they were gonna be in a jar.\nNo.\nThis is a big part of the biz, my man.\nNetworking, face time, making deals.\nNormally, this would have a much sexier, businessman's vibe.\nBut not when I'm dragging around this old drooling potato.\nPotata? Yeah, I can split a baked potata.\nWhat a life you must have lead.\nTell us about the street car, will you? Oh, it was a dynamite way to get around.\nMm-hmm.\nPasadena to to the beach - Hey.\nI'll take another one of these.\nSure.\nYou know, Cece, I can't help but think that I am just following another bad lead with this marketing thing.\nAll I'm doing is taking a bunch of notes for Schmidt.\nWhat's this? \"Seems befuddled and totally lucid\"? - \"Smells too clean\"? - Those were just notes about Ed.\nI'll tell you what.\nThat dude is way more interesting than marketing.\nIf I'm gonna take Gwen's job and become the next CIO of Ass-Strat, I can't just embrace modernization.\nI got to make babies with it.\nDo you know what I mean? It's time to unveil my baby.\nMicro-marketing.\nYeah, we target our messages directly to the individual consumer.\nWhat a good idea.\nThey're gonna hold a ticker-tape parade for you in the Jewish part of town.\nThat's right.\nIn the Jewish part of town.\nMm.\nNothing but net.\nTraditionally, \"Nothing but net\" refers to hitting nothing but inside of the net.\nOh? - Ah, so, yeah, no.\nOh, time-out.\nButt bump.\nWhat? - I'm ready.\nWhat? The butt? Oh.\nCome on.\nAll right.\nHey! Hey! What is that? - It's the Pistons butt bump.\nI didn't know your girlfriend was a Pistons fan.\nThat's got to suck for you, man.\nBut I guess everything sucks for you when you root for the Bulls.\nButt bump! Ah.\nAh.\nOoh.\nOh, cool, cool, cool.\nSo you're a Pistons fan now, Jess? - Suck it, Bulls! - Yeah.\nSuck it, Bulls! The worst team in the League, the Bulls.\nOh, it's the worst team in the League, all right.\nWho is the worst team in the League, Jess? The Bulls.\nThe Bulls are the worst team in the League.\nHey.\nSo, went really well today.\nI think Coach and I are really connecting.\nCome on, what is that? What do you mean? What? Oh, Coach gave this to me.\nHow cute is this shirt? Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm gonna need you to get out of my bed.\nWhy? Because of the shirt? - 100% because of the shirt.\nOh, my God, you're serious.\nI can't have you in my bed in a Pistons shirt.\nOh, my God! - I need you to get out of the bed.\nJess, I need you to get out of there.\nI tried being cool about it, but it's not cool.\nReally? - Really.\nNick, it's just basketball.\nWhy are you taking this personally? Because it's personal, Jess! That's my team.\nIt's the city that I'm from.\nIt's most of my relationship with my dad.\nR.\nI.\nP.\n, by the way.\nMichael Jordan.\nThe first man that taught me that I could love a man.\nAnd the Pistons are our rivals.\nThey're like in Hamlet The McCalls and the Sh Hacksperes.\nYou're my girlfriend now, so You got to be a Bulls fan.\nThat's the whole point, Nick.\nCoach just thinks of me as your girlfriend, and I want him to know me for me.\nDo you want me to be friends with Coach? I-I absolutely do.\nYes.\nSo, then, why can't I be a Pistons fan until we become friends, and then I'll switch to the Bulls? So every year you can just pick a new team? You meet a new friend, you're a fan of that? - I could never trust you.\nCan we just have sex now, please? I'm sorry.\nYou can't be a Pistons fan.\nI forbid it.\nIt has to be this way.\nYou can't forbid me to do stuff.\nThat's just not you That's not within your power.\nI just did.\nThe shirt stays! Jessica, you're leaving me no options here.\nI'm gonna have to turn off the tap.\nWhat tap? - The sex tap.\nBut I need my vitamin D.\nAs long as you're wearing that shirt, the tap is off.\nNo more hot water.\nAll right, fine, then.\nMy shirt and I will go sleep in my bed.\nOh.\nWhat happened to your Pistons jersey? Did you rip it off and rush in here 'cause she got to have it? - Look, is this still a thing? - Oh, it's still a thing.\nNo sex for you as long as you're a Pistons fan.\nYou can't use sex to manipulate What are you doing? Just brushing my dirty teeth.\nThey're filthy.\nNick, do not challenge me to a sex standoff.\nI can channel all my sexual energy into knitting.\nHow do you think I made it through high school? It's good when you go fast and then slow.\nMake the teeth wait for it.\nYou're on.\nOh! Yeah! - Oh! Yeah! Turnover! - Dunk it from the downtown! - Go! Go! Go! - Pass that pumpkin to Josh Smith.\nYou better listen to my friend.\nShe knows exactly what she's talking about! Did you just call me your friend? What's up, guys? Ah, two minutes in, and the Pistons are already down by ten.\nWhat a drag.\nWhat the heck are you wearing, dude?\nJust my Scottie Pippens.\nYeah.\nOh, hey, I'm just checking up on you.\nYou frustrated at all?\nYou need your vitamin D?\nNo.\n\n\n\nJessica - Three-point play! Yes! - Oh, yeah! - That's what I'm talking about! - We are talking about the same thing My friend and I.\nDo my berries make you hungry? Mmm.\nRefreshing.\nJust drink the water, Nick.\nYou're turning yourself on now.\nI really am, yeah.\nOkay, next order of business is Kim, if I may, uh, present an idea very quickly to the group.\nWhile I know - Micro-marketing.\nWhat? Has this company ever considered targeting its message to individual consumers? Big data's knocking.\nLet's open the door.\nJust a thought.\nYeah, interesting.\nEd, look into that and present it to the board asap.\nGreat job.\nI'd hug you, but you smell like a public library.\nWhat are you doing? - I may be dirty, but I play old.\nYou said that wrong.\nAnd yet I got my paw wrapped around your avacadas.\nWhat is with you and avacadas? Sorry.\nYou're never gonna believe what Ed just did.\nHe stabbed you in the back.\nWinston, that's exactly what happened.\nHow did you do that? I figured him out, Schmidt.\nThat liver spot out-sharked me.\nCan you believe that? I'm-I'm a minnow.\nTomorrow, Ed is gonna present my idea to the board, and then he's gonna get the get the promotion.\nMy career is toast.\nMinnow toast.\nYeah, well, I tip my hat to him.\nThe minnow tips his tiny hat to the shark, and then lays down on the toast to be eaten.\nThere is too much going on in whatever metaphor you're trying.\nOkay? It's too busy.\nSomewhat made se Oh, forget it.\nEd wins.\nI'm a mess.\nHell, no, Schmidt.\nJustice has to be served, all right? - Mm-hmm.\nRight.\nLet us stop Ed.\nThe minnow needs to get up off of No, off of the toast mat and fish-fight his way to the orangutan ball.\nI just don't understand why they keep giving these games away! You know what it was? It was that turnover in the third quarter.\nRight.\nYeah.\nI'll show you.\nI can just take your word for it.\nActually, let's do it from the beginning.\nYou want to watch the game we just watched all over again? - Mm-hmm.\nWith both overtimes? Great.\nLooking for somebody? - Just doing a bed check.\nAnd you are accounted for, so - See you.\nSo, how's it going? You guys bonding over basketball, Jess? We're actually this close to moving past basketball and into real friendship, so - Great.\nI'm feeling pretty good about it.\nAfter the Pistons lost, did he get really sad and talk to you about it? About how he felt and you guys became besties after? Or did that not happen because that's not the way men are? The Pistons lost, so you must be feeling pretty good.\nOh, I'm happy, yeah.\nYeah? - You're feeling excited? - Mm-hmm.\nWorked up? - Yeah.\nReady to cave? - Oh, I've never been stronger.\nOh, yeah? So if I just read you a description of Like, what a Piston does, you know, on my phone, it wouldn't affect you at all? Is that what you're saying? It's just a rod that transfers, uh, force from the crank shaft What is this, a seduction class for kindergarteners? Watch the master work.\nHow about this? A little Paula Abdul stuff.\nYeah.\nAre we doing this? - Ha! - What are you doing? Ball's in my court now, pal.\nI'm turning off my tap until you become a Pistons fan.\nHey, that wasn't part of the deal.\nIt is now.\nI can't figure out my counterstrike, Winston.\nThe only thing we know about Ed is that he's old and cranky, and he baffles me because I'm so darn young and pleasant.\nWe just got to get inside into his old, cranky mind.\nWe have to find an older, crankier mind.\nHow are we gonna find an older, crankier mind than Ed? Hey, where are you guys getting your photos developed these days?

No, here's the reality, you never know what's gonna happen with a phone.\nRight.\nThe hinges that hold the flip together, they get loosened over time when-when they get wet.\nAnd then once you open it, it's easier for people to go in there and see your passwords and, you know, see your codes.\nOnce the screen breaks, your information's in the Twitterverse, man.\nAnd it's all out there for everyone to see, all these little monkey elves, man, all these kids.\nThat's all they do.\nGet your information, man.\nBottom line is you can't control your technology.\nThat's what's going on in Japan with all those robots.\nNot for me, man.\nThat's why I trust a hard copy.\nPlain and simple.\nHard copy, Schmidt.\nNice work.\nThank you.\nAnd, Nick, you know, if you're gonna be taking boudoir shots, please consult me.\nI know.\nI have a series of poses that many people, including myself, find very sexy.\nOkay, here's one that I call the half Nelson.\nYeah, I didn't do that.\nThis is called a Guy Fieri.\nJust taste the sauces.\nYeah.\nBlack licorice.\nYeah.\nYou're welcome.\nSchmidt's dead wrong.\nOh, yeah? - I got some real hot pics in here.\nI don't care.\nThere's one of me as a sexy mayor, looking out the window, deciding the future of my city.\nIt's got to get her going.\nDaddy needs his cookie.\nDude, just wear the damn Pistons jersey.\nOh, my God, I've got to end this.\nWhat time is it?!

That was from a movie.\nTraining Day's my favorite movie.\nI understand that, but you understand that's not what being a cop is.\nI want to drop fools! Huh? That's what you're telling me? If you think this means you can start yelling at me You damn right, sucker! That's what that means.\nOh, I apologize about that.\nJess? Jessica Day-hey-ey.\nI just want to say that, um, I would love to be your friend.\nLook, I know I'm crazy about the Pistons, but it's just because Detroit was the city I lived in the longest as a kid.\nYes.\nI lived in, like, six different states by the time I was ten.\nAt a certain point, I just Stopped trying to make friends.\nGot real comfy on that.\nReally?

I was just curious.\nNick, you got a whole team of friends pulling for you, okay? Just get yourself home.\nYou can still pull this off.\nHey, Mike.\n-What? - So I cleaned out the beer trap, I polished all these wine glasses, and I turned that penis graffiti in the bathroom into a whimsical hat.\nNow my friend and I have to go to a party.\nAll right, Schmidt, let's go.\nYou called me your friend.\nDid I?

Of course I do.\nBut I wasn't gonna say it like that.\nI was gonna wait, Winston.\nYou blurted it out.\nIt's not a big deal.\nThat's what I always do.\nI love you! Sometimes they say it back, sometimes they don't I mean, it's like a numbers game.\nI always do this.\nI always get too intent, and then I freak girls out.\nI blew it.\nWhat do I do? Well, Nick, you can't take it back.\nWell, that's not 100% true.\nDamn! Prince's house! Not bad, Prince! You think Prince has a pool? You think he has a drawbridge?

No, I can't.\nFinger guns? That was so stupid.\nMy brain just froze.\nIf the limo guy hadn't pulled away, I probably would've done a lasso.\nI think you were just a little scared.\nScared of what? Saying \"I love you\"? I say \"I love you\" all the time.\nI'll say it right now: I love you!

Who's this guy? - Nick Miller? - Is that Schmidt? - You scoundrel, you.\nWell, hot damn.\nCome here.\nIt's good to see you.\nYeah, well, the feeling's not mutual! The last time I saw him, I was on the desert, and he was putting my mother into a prison.\nYou don't understand what we're doing, do you? Keep this animal away from me! You know what? It's my fault.\nWe didn't rehearse.\nWe didn't rehearse.\nCan we come into the party? You know what? We're gonna wait back here.\nI get it.\nIt's my fault.\nIt's - Nick? - I'm Trojan horsing inside a bunch of models.\nEvery ham for himself.\nNo, Nick! Let me in there!

What are you doing here?! - I'm so happy to see you! - Yeah.\nHow'd you get in? - I need to talk to you.\nI know.\nI can't leave it the way that was.\nI know, because there's something, um, I really should have said back there and I didn't, and, um I think it's important that I say to you.\nSo, uh, what I wanted to say is, Nick Miller I Jess! She's all right.\nHey, Jess, you okay? Hi.\nWhat happened? You had a panic attack and you fell down.\nOh, my God Which is actually worse than finger guns.\nI didn't think that was possible.\nI think it's fair to say that I did not handle the situation very well.\nNo, look, it's fine.\nIn fact, I want to take the whole thing back, Jess.\nWhat? I shouldn't have said it, it was an accident and, uh yeah, so just kind of clear the air.\nNo! No, Nick! This just got very awkward.\nBe strong, Nick! What did? What? - What's that? - I'm outside the hedge! You see my arm? I'm trying to push through! What are you doing up there? Be careful! I lost my bearings! I had to go high to avoid the spiders! - Nick - Just wait for him to finish.\nI'm breaching! - Uh - Whoa! Easy! Easy! Aah! Aah! Oh! Prince is terrible at Frisbee.\nThere's, like, ten of these things up there.\nHey, guys, can I talk to Nick alone for a second? You got it.\nYeah.\nYou're taking it back? Is that how you really feel? Well how do you feel? Hi.\nI'm Prince.\nSo what seems to be the problem? Oh, how rude of me.\nI haven't given you enough time to freak out yet.\nYou may do so now.\nOh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nick! So, I'm not familiar with this term \"finger guns.\n\" Can you elaborate? Uh, yeah, it's a Whoa.\nDon't point those at me.\nThey might go off.\nThat was very much of your flavor of humor.\nListen, Nick, uh Nick, right? Yes, that's my name.\nJess and I are gonna take a moment to just be alone.\nI'm-I'm not worried, but why? What are you gonna talk to her about? You.\nNick, I never thought I'd say this, but I need to be alone with Prince.\nAll right, well Yeah.\nSo, do you like pancakes? Ooh, ooh.\nCece, help! The bouncer's after me.\nOh, all right.\nOkay.\nHe's gone.\nHe's gone, Schmidt.\nIs he gone? - Mm-hmm.\nYou can stop now.\nHe's tenacious.\nHe's definitely gonna be back.\nPretty sure it's all clear.\nIt's always good to see old friends.\nThank you.\nSo, tonight's the night we're just gonna leave this all behind and get cooler friends, right? Yeah, right.\nWe should be dead.\nWe should be dead.\nI never thought I was gonna see him again! He's getting emotional right now, because this is real.\nOh, if you cry, I'm gonna cry.\nAnd then I'm gonna cry, then we can just cry together.\nPoor Freddy.\nJess is with Prince! And I've been drinking.\nWait Jess is with Prince? And I've been drinking.\nWho are these two? Come on, man.\nFire and Ice, dude.\nGet out.\nIt's getting warm in here isn't it? - Yes.\nIt's actually a little chilly.\nWe're Oh, give me a break.\nI see what you're doing.\nMm-mm.\nYou're trying to tempt me sexually.\nNot interested.\nWhat are you doing, Nick? That leads to me taking my jacket off, and all of a sudden, you guys got me in my underwear, huh? I'm not a dummy.\nTake a walk.\nNo one's interested.\nSo rude.\nHow idiotic.\nWe got business.\nRude? No, no, no, no, no, no, stay, stay, stay.\nLet's go.\nIdiot! Yeah, I'm an idiot.\nCiao.\nNo, no, no ciao! No ciao.\nYou'll be replaced by robots before you can say, \"Fragi-cava-licious.\n\" You're bringing Fire and Ice down! Yeah, man.\nYou don't bring Fire and Ice down.\nDon't start with me right now.\nI'm having a terrible day.\nWho cares about them? Who cares? I care! I feel like dancing right now.\nDancing's not the answer.\nYou can't dance.\nIt's only gonna get worse.\nLet's tear the roof off this joint, and show Prince how we do! Thanks, Charles.\nYou want to know why you can't tell that nice dude you love him? I want to say it, but You're scared.\nExactly.\nIf you say it and things don't work out, what then? I really care for him.\nAnd I'm just worried I'm gonna lose him.\nThat's stupid.\nYou're stupid.\nI forgive you.\nOh, my God, thank God! - Besides anything beautiful is worth getting hurt for.\nWell, that's very well put.\nYou know who said that? No.\nMe.\nYou're good.\nGod.\nI wish I were more like you, Prince.\nFinish your pancake.\nLet's get to work.\nOh, it's really good.\nBut I'm super full.\nPancake.\nOkay.\nHere, put this on.\nOh, that's beautiful, but I don't think I could pull that off.\nDon't argue with me.\nOkay.\nRepeat after me.\nLove.\nLove.\nLove.\nLove.\nWhat am I supposed to be learning here? - Love.\nLove.\nLove.\nLove.\nYou're not saying it right.\nDo you understand now?

When she's mad, she just says \"Nic.\n\" Do you really think that the \"K\" adds to the sound of your name? - Yes.\nHow do you usually say your name? - Nick.\nSay it without the \"K.\n\" - Nic.\nIt's the same thing.\nStop distracting me! Nick, you're so worried about disappointing Jess.\nRelax, man.\n(ding) Okay, you got to get out of here.\n(grunts) (moans) (grunts) (giggles) Oh I choked.\nI choked, man.\nI'm 31.\nI have nothing figured out.\nCan I not find a job? - I mean, I feel like I'm losing it.\nDude, they're hiring here.\nYou know I can't work here, man.\nThey never have any cookies.\nIt's all the better, man! There's no pressure.\nYou get this job and then when you're ready, you try the cop thing again.\nOkay.\nSee? - Yeah.\nBut now I'm sitting here thinking about how badly I need this job.\nStop! - I need this job real bad Excuse me, um, could we get a job application over here, please? In a way, I have a lot more riding on this job than I do the cop thing.\nGod, I'd love to work here! Jess: I got the apartment! The place is great.\nThe only thing I'm a little worried about is there is a Russian grocery store down the block and Abby has a little bit of a weird thing with ethnic white people.\nBut I think she could really thrive there! Where is she? - Where's who? - Abby.\nAb? Oh, she's sleeping.\nBy herself.\nWhich is called \"napping.\n\" Okay, I'm gonna start secretly packing up some of her stuff.\nDo you think you can keep distracting her? - Yes, yeah, you know, just - Good.\nhow do we distract her? How do you distract a woman like that? Probably a guy.\n(laughs): Right? Who can we set her up with? Well, well, well, who do we have? Coach.\n(laughs) No.\nWinston That's actually kind of a good idea No! - Schmidt! - That's a terrible idea.\nBut in the same sense Abby will wreck Schmidt! - Well, then luckily, the - So, here's the plan.\nWe're gonna have a nice dinner, we're gonna get her buzzed but not drunk.\nAnd then we're gonna casually and naturally bring up the apartment so she thinks it's her idea.\nAnd I can do that, okay? - Okay, good.\nI'm glad.\nI'll act cool, natural.\nCasual.\nAu naturel.\nAu casual.\nYou know what? Maybe I should write you some lines, pal.\nYeah, I'd really appreciate that 'cause Maybe not a lot of words.\nUh, so tell me, what are your three weakest qualities? (chuckles) See (whispering): Just say \"perfectionist.\n\" - Perfectionist.\nYeah.\nAnd the other two um (laughs) (sputtering) I'm overheating, right? I'm overheating, okay? So here's what we're gonna do now I'm just gonna shoot from the hip, little rapid fire, give you some fun facts you might not know about me.\nI hate standing up, I'm bad with numbers, and I just honestly, from the bottom of my heart, don't think women should be allowed to handle money.\nJust, that's for real.\nLet's just move on to the salary.\nAnd you didn't even fill out the back of the application.\nThere's a back? There is a back to the application? - Coach.\nWhat? The LAPD exam maybe it had a back.\nYou didn't check to see if it had a back? We got to go to the precinct.\nI didn't choke.\nI'm just careless.\nAnd that is my biggest weakness, you bitch.\nI'm so sorry, dude.\nI'm so sorry, dude.\nYeah, that was bad.\nMan, I didn't even mean that.\nAll right, get out of here.\nGet out of here.\nDawg, I didn't mean that at all, man.\nTo our newest resident.\nThe City of Angels has sprouted another pair of wings.\nIt's a majestic city, drenched in sunshine, that is actually just a collection of 75 different neighborhoods.\nWow, I had no idea.\nPlease continue to tell me more.\nYou want more? - Who wants to rediscover couscous? Hey, what the hell are you doing here, Schmidt? I invited him.\nI live here, too, right? - Yeah, but It's okay, Abby can make her own decisions, no matter what they might lead to.\nThank you.\nNow, somebody call the pound 'cause my stomach is growling.\nI said my stomach is growling.\nSp okay, uh, speaking of dinner, there are a lot of great options in North Hollywood.\nIt's a real hot spot full of young, hip people who will be the leaders of tomorrow.\nMore wine? - Great.\nIf I were moving to L.\nA.\nnow, I'd say yes-ho to NoHo.\nNick: Hey, hey, what are you doing? Oh, my.\nStop touching him, Abby.\nI'm sorry, what'd you say? - Touch him more? - Do not touch him.\nWhat are you? Do not do this right now.\n(whispering): How about that? As luck would have it, I actually know of a place in North Hollywood with great tile work.\n(pouring wine) I said, \"Great tile work.\n\" Oh, for the first 12 months.\n(Jess laughs) I think what you really mean to say is there's an introductory offer - for cable television.\nThat's it, yeah Cable's a scam, I tell ya.\nSa Satellite.\nWhat happened to no nonsense, Schmidt? Satellite's where it's at.\n(whispering): Nonsense has the hands of an angel.\nOkay, what's going on here? (chuckles) I told Abby about the apartment, and now she's giving Schmidt a sp a special.\nDon't look at me.\nJust look away.\nLook away, look or look right at me.\nSo this was going on the whole time? - Yes.\nAnd the hands are just the half of it.\nI mean, there's been banging and poking and scratching and hanging and teasing such teasing.\nI mean, really excruciating, life-giving teasing.\nShut up, Schmidt! She was talking to me.\nThis has been a whole day of lying and I can't take it.\nFirst I had to lie to Abby, and so I spilled the beans - about the apartment.\nI'm sorry.\nAnd then I had to lie about Abby and Schmidt and the boning.\nAnd then the manipulating and the out-manipulating That's lying! If you guys were just honest with each other for one second, none of this would have happened.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nAbby I'm really sorry I tried to trick you, but I just want what's best for you.\nOne of us has to! - You know, that is your problem.\nYou think you're better than people and you always try to fix them.\nNo, I don't! - Yes, you do.\nYou've done it your whole life.\nIt's annoying.\nYou know what? Yes.\nYes.\nI would like to fix you.\nNo I would love to fix you! But I'm done trying.\nBecause you're not changing.\nAnd you don't think or care about other people at all, and I do.\nAnd that's why I don't want you living in this loft.\n(scoffs) That's honest.\nYou're a garbage person and you should live in a Dumpster with rotten snails.\nHey! Nick! - Too far! - Yeah, way over the line, buddy.\nYeah, but I thought we were just piling in That's my sister, dude.\nI didn't mean that, yeah.\nSorry.\nWell, lucky for you, I'm moving out.\nOh, thank God, Abby.\nOh, my God.\nYou're really gonna like this place.\nIt's so nice - I'm moving in with Schmidt.\nWhat what's that, now? You're moving in with who? - Seriously? - We would have sex all the time.\n(chuckles) Dinner was lovely, you guys.\nThank you so much.\nBye.\nWhat? - Schmidt: Ooh.\nHey, uh, Jess? Can I borrow your glasses? We're gonna role-play as you guys.\nEw.\nNo.\nYou don't understand.\nShe's not gonna be you.\nI'm gonna be you.\nUgh! Get out, Schmidt! Get out of here! Okay Oh, God! Winston: What's up, my man? I took the test last week or should I say, I took the front part of the test last week and, sir, I am here to finish what I started.\nWhat? What he's trying to say is, he took the entrance exam, but he forgot to do the back half.\nWell, the test is administered on a computer.\nThere is no back.\nYou took the test on a computer? I choked.\nI am a failure.\nI am a loser.\nI am never gonna amount to anything.\nI'm never gonna shoot somebody.\nDude.\nHave some dignity, all right? Thank you for your time, sir.\nCoach: Winston.\nWinston! Yo! Winston! Dude, you failed, man.\nYou failed hard! At everything! - Dude, this pep talk sucks.\nI'm not finished.\nLike, seriously, it's like the Winston of pep talks.\nLook at me.\nYou can do this, Winston.\nBecause now there's nothing to be afraid of.\nYou hit rock bottom, man.\nThis is the worst it's gonna get.\nSir, it has been my dream to become a cop.\nAnd no one's gonna stand in my way not you, not him Hey, I was helping.\nand definitely not myself.\nI would like to retake this test.\nWell, there's one at 7:30 tomorrow.\nMan, what about my last score makes you think I'm ready to take this test again in 12 hours? Coach: He'll be there.\nYeah, I'll be there.\nYeah.\nThank you for messing everything up and being such a terrible liar.\nUh, you are very welcome.\nI think I really needed to say that stuff to my sister.\nShe's gonna wreck Schmidt.\nOof He has no idea.\nI'm sorry my family's so crazy.\nCrazy? Your family's not crazy.\nMy family's crazy.\nMy father used to trade horse semen.\nI've got an uncle whose God-given name is Shifty.\n(laughing) Well, thank goodness we're the sane ones.\n(chuckles) So - Okay, now, remember: Up, and - Uh-huh.\n(screams) (elevator bell dings) Hello, Abby.\nHey.\nS'up? Have you thought about what you're gonna do if they pair you with a dirty cop? Well, then, I would just go to Internal Affairs.\nWell, that's a good way to get killed.\nThen at least I would die a hero.\nHmm, no, you won't.\nThey'll put you in panties and then they'll plant you next to a dead prostitute.\nThat's a poor lady.\nIt'd be a dude.\nBut it's awesome! Good luck on the exam! They got dude prostitutes? Nuh-uh.\n"}, {"title": "03x18 - Sister III.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThank you so much for having us over for brunch, guys.\nIt's the least that we could do to celebrate the one-week anniversary of your sister moving in with me and becoming my live-in lover.\nWas a little fast.\nBabe, you have syrup on your face.\nOh, you can get it.\nMmm.\nBabe, you have some powdered sugar (muffled): Back off! I'm starving! Come on.\nJust let me get it off.\nIt's so much.\nGet your own French toast, Jess! I got these slices, so they're for me to eat.\nIf you want the slices, get your own slices.\nCoach: Um, that's your fourth plate, Winston.\nI'm trying to bulk up for the LAPD fitness exam.\nI am going to ace this obstacle course.\nSchmidt, you got something crazy around your neck.\nAbby made this.\nLook.\nOw.\nLook at that.\nNot a fan.\nI forgot how much I love making jewelry.\nSchmidt's been lending me money for supplies.\nYeah.\nSchmidt, are you bleeding? Oh, look at that.\nI most certainly am.\nWow.\nWhat makes Abby's jewelry so interesting is that it's actually dangerous and can cut you.\nAbby's gonna open up her own store one day.\nMark my words.\nShe shouldn't do that.\nNope.\nI'm gonna open up a store in your mouth.\nBut now that you're living here, I can have my old room back.\nJess, I'm gonna need you gone by 5:00.\nDone.\nI need a break from Snore-a Ephron over here.\nOkay.\nOh, Schmidt and I don't need any space.\nWe have no boundaries.\nBut I guess not everybody can have what Schmidt and I have.\nYou guys will probably get there.\nDon't worry.\nRemember how long it took you to get boobs? Yeah, but I started shaving my legs at nine.\nSo joke's on you.\nMmm.\nWait.\nWe have so much sex.\nDon't try to eat the other slice.\nI'm gonna get to it.\nWho's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.\nCan you believe Abby and Schmidt? Yeah, tell me about it.\nMaking love at their own brunch? No class.\nThey're a fake couple.\nThey're not real.\nWe're a real couple.\nIf anyone should be moving in together, it's us.\nWell, you know, we already live in the same apartment.\nRight.\nSo why not take the extra step? We basically sleep in each other's rooms every night, so what is the difference? It's a really big difference.\nBecause right now we're roommates but we're not living together.\nNot \"living together.\n\" - You know? - No.\nLiving together is a step.\nIt's official.\nIt's an official step in a relationship.\nSo the word \"official\" is the key.\nAbby and Schmidt did it after one week.\nCome on.\nWe have so much left to learn about each other, stuff you can only learn if you're crammed together in a small space and you can't get out.\nJust you and me.\nFour walls.\nNo boundaries, no escape.\nWhen you put it like that, it sounds amazing.\nAnd like prison.\nWell, I feel like if we get tired of each other, I can always run across the hall to my room.\nIt's so close.\nJust pop over there.\nMm.\nDo you not want to? - Whoa.\n(whistles) I did not - That did not - So you're saying you do want to? (chuckles) Oh, my God, Nick, we're moving in together! - Officially? We just agreed on it? - Yes! Yes! I cannot think of a reason why not to.\nReason 13: I like my stuff and I hate her stuff.\nReason number 14: How am I ever gonna change my clothes? You don't change in front of your girlfriend? You get naked in front of her.\nYes, but those are different things.\nWhen you're naked, you're powerful and it's glorious.\nWhen you're changing, you're hunched over and cowering, like an animal.\nAnimals don't wear clothes, Nick.\nAll I'm saying is I need my space.\nTrue intimacy.\nEmbrace that.\nAbby and I, we have one sponge.\nAnd we use it for everything.\nI don't like that, but you seem happy.\nDon't hold back, Nick.\nExpose your cracks and love will fill them.\nThat's nice.\nThank you.\nDo you know how hard it's been for me to take this conversation seriously while you're wearing - that thing around your neck? - It's an Iroquois throat band.\nThat's the ugliest thing I've ever seen.\nYeah, you're jealous.\nNo, I'm not.\nIt's not just a choker, it's story.\nWhat's the story? She didn't have enough supplies? - I'm not through the whole thing yet.\nI got to tell you, man, looking at that thing, the sex must be awesome.\nCoach: Cece and I have been hanging out a lot more lately.\nShe sort of treats me like I'm one of her girl friends, and (strained): You don't like it? I love it.\nI mean, usually, when I'm friends with a girl, I'm either trying to get that butt or she's trying to get this butt.\nBut with Cece, it's not about the butt.\n(chuckles) It's not about the butt, man.\nIt's cool.\nIt's like We're like sisters.\nWhat? Coach.\nHey, do you have, uh, Schmidt's keys? Kind of got a weird favor to ask.\nIt's only weird if you don't ask, girl.\n(laughs) - What? - That's what I'm talking about.\n(meows) (grunts) You know I'm doing this for you, right? - Somewhere - This is great.\n(chuckles) What are we doing? We are snooping on Abby.\nOh, love it.\nI do not trust that girl.\nShe's always working an angle.\nNow she's got Schmidt all wrapped up, giving her money for \"jewelry.\n\" Treachery! (Coach screams) First, they came for my silverware and I said nothing.\nWhat's up, dawg? - What are you guys doing here? Schmidt, I know that Abby is fun and she is charming, but I'm telling you, she's bad news.\nIs that why you guys are sorting through my garbage? I appreciate the concern, you guys, but Abby has changed.\nCoach: Then how do you explain this? I put my coffee grounds in a plastic bag so it doesn't get the rest of my trash dirty.\nReally? - Yeah, he does that.\nYou got clean-ass trash, man.\nI don't even need gloves for this.\nQuit sorting through my trash, Coach.\nYou're messing it all up.\nSchmidt, you've known this girl for a couple weeks, okay? I've known her for 20 years, and, I am telling you, she's not to be trusted.\nYour words are changing his opinions about things.\n(chuckles) Up top.\nMm.\nYou two as friends is a real bummer.\nI'm not into it.\nJess: Our first night living together.\nI'm just excited.\nExpose your cracks and love will fill them.\nI'm changing.\nGreat.\nI'm reading.\nOkay.\nYeah, I'm just gonna take my pants off.\nOkay.\n(grumbling) You know, I've seen you naked before, right? What's going on there? Oh! Never changed in front of a woman.\nYou know, mostly you just hook up and - Really? Are you serious? All right, I'm gonna read.\n(clears throat) Okay.\nHere we go.\n(Nick moans) Yeah, it's Just gonna put this on here.\nWhat is that? Oh, this is my long shirt.\n(snorts) - Yeah.\nOh.\nThat's why you're laughing.\nI had it on the wrong way.\n(laughs) That must have been funny-looking the way it was.\nI've never broken it out before you because, you know, we didn't live together, but it keeps the top really warm and lets my bottom breathe.\nAnd so yeah.\nWhy does your bottom need to breathe? Well, it's like a plant.\nNeeds sun and air to survive.\nNever mind.\nUm I like it.\nUm yeah.\nGreat.\nI like it.\n(grunts) Okay.\nThis is great.\nThis is great.\nI'm excited.\nMe, too.\nWhat are you doing to the pillow? - I'm trying to get comfortable.\nOh, okay.\nGot it.\nGot it.\nI can't I'm gonna go to sleep.\nTurn off the light.\nGreat.\nMm.\nOw! What? So-Sorry.\nSorry.\nWhat the hell is that nightmare? - I just have to Sorry.\nJust reading.\nYeah.\nYou know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna sleep with my head over there.\nOkay.\nYeah, that's That's gonna be better for me.\nYou know what, I'm gonna get some water.\n(muffled music playing) - Oh, hey.\nMy room looks totally different.\nTurned it into a workout space.\nI am so glad it opened up.\nOh, why didn't we do this sooner? Crab walk.\nYou don't know where a crab's gonna go.\nAnd you know what? Where does the crab go? Oh! Oh, aah! Owie.\n(elevator bell dings) Hi.\nJust enjoying the peace and quiet.\nWhoa, hold up.\nHey, Jess, what are you doing? Oh, I just, you know, sometimes I work in the elevator now.\n(whispers): You know, helping some of the older residents.\nHmm? (elevator bell dings) (loudly): This is your floor, ma'am.\nSo, how are things going with you and Schmidt living together? I have never felt so clean while being so dirty.\nAwesome.\nLast night, Schmidt wanted to take me to a hotel, but we could not even get out of the loft without ripping each other's clothes off.\nOh, that's our thing, too.\nWe have the hotel until tomorrow night and it's all paid up.\nYou guys might as well use it.\nTake it off our hands.\n(elevator bell dings) Lobby, please.\n(mouths words) Wait, I forgot Bernie.\nHold the elevator.\nBernie, Bernie, where are you, you idiot? I'll just be here, waiting.\nWinston: So, Nick, the police academy training is going well, but I'm a little worried about the rings, because of the you know the incident.\n(laughter) Shut up, you guys, I can do this.\nNo, Miller, no, Miller, no! (laughter) (laughs) I'm sor I got big laughs.\nYou got to give the people what they want.\nEverybody saw my ding-a-ling, Nick.\nMy ding-a-ling.\n\n\n\nI've got an issue that's more important than this.\nEver since Jess moved in, I haven't had a second to myself.\nYou see what she's done to my writer's desk? It's like an arts and crafts area now, man.\nHey, guys.\nHey.\nI'm staying at a hotel tonight.\nNot alone.\nWith other people.\nI have to chaperone a field trip to Sacramento, so You know what, you seem too busy to talk about it.\nGo, go.\nI'm gonna miss you.\nI'm gonna miss you.\nWait, weren't you just saying how you Whoa, dude! (Jess laughs) - Good one, Nick.\nBye.\nBye, yeah.\nThat, uh, I'm, uh, I'm sorry.\nSchmidt: I can't believe I let you guys talk me into tailing my own girlfriend.\nCece: Look at this neighborhood, Schmidt, she is up to no good.\nI feel very uncomfortable being here, I trust Abby, I don't want to spy on her any more, okay? We're not spying.\nWe're just carefully watching.\nGirlfriend is going down.\nYeah, she is.\nLet us bust her, buster.\n(giggles) That was a good one.\nThat was.\nYeah.\nOkay.\n(both sigh) This dynamic between the two of you It's very annoying to me.\nI'm sure I'm not alone on this.\nHi, hater.\nBye, hater.\nOkay, enough is enough.\nI'm getting out of here.\nHey, it's my car - Guys, guys.\nI don't care whose car it is, I'm going.\nI don't care who - It's my car.\nOh.\nAah! (gasps) Great.\nHit a parked car in the same neighborhood they shot friggin' Children of Men.\nYeah! I'm alone! (laughs) Yeah.\nI made my reservation I'm leaving town tomorrow (yells happily) I'll find somebody new (grunts, laughs) I'm alone and I love it.\nCoffee for one, a sundae for one, and the most tasteful, story-driven (whispers) adult film.\nPreferably a period piece.\nThe farther in the past, the better.\nYou know what I'm talking about, girl.\n(sobs) Do you have anything in the Byzantine Era? No? All right, just a shot in the dark.\nClang, clang, clang, went the trolley (sobbing): It's so little.\nIt's so little.\nBump, bump, bump went my heartstrings When he smiled, I could feel the car shake (pounding on wall): I'm trying to sleep! - Okay! - Which ding is ours? - Which ding is ours? Coach, there are knife holes in the door.\nWhat does it matter? Let's get out of here.\nAt least write \"sorry\" and put it under the windshield wiper There are none.\nUh Maybe put it under the dead bird's leg? - Hobo! - Aah, there's a dude! (screaming) Ho-ho-hobo, for real! - Hobo! - Son of a bitch Hobo.\nThank you, Jingles.\nYou got it, girl.\nHey.\nWhat are you guys doing here? Tailing me? - No.\nUm - Yes, we're tailing you.\nI know how you work: You glom onto guys and then you just bleed them dry.\nWell, you are not gonna do it to Schmidt.\nWhat's in the box? Tell us what's in the box.\nZippers.\nWhat? (laughs) Z Zippers, you guys.\nGuy up there'll give you a great deal.\nHe also loves crack.\nCan we go now? Thank you, Abby, let's go.\nMy car is gone.\nWell, that's not surprising.\nOh, you can do this.\nYou can do this, Winnie.\nWhat are you doing here? On a school day? I see this means you're the cutting type.\nWhich means you're the pantsing type.\nWell, I got news for you, buddy.\nYou ain't getting 'em! Not today.\nHow 'bout I take your pants, huh? Not like that, everybody! I'm not trying to take the little kid's pants.\nHe's trying to take my pants.\nYou see how he's eyeing my pants? So I eyed his pants You know what? You win.\nYou win, you little son of a bitch.\nYou win! I don't want to tell you how to police your beach, but right now there are truants outside of this hotel, stirring up trouble.\nHey, yo, lookin' good, Charlie! Debbie, see you at 1:00 on the massage table.\nWinston.\nMm.\nWe are gonna sneak into Schmidt's and see what's really inside those boxes.\nCece, darling - Hmm? - What? - How long have we been friends? A week or so? - And have I ever steered you wrong? - Well, no Exactly.\nBecause I know you better than anyone, girl.\nAnd you're acting like a lunatic.\nI mean, the kind of lunatic other lunatics look at and go, \"Oh, my God, that bitch a lunatic.\n\" So I'm gonna need you to figure out why you're really doing all this for Schmidt and then sort it out.\nYou did not just say that to me.\nThink about it, girl.\nShoot Just to be clear, I did not ask you to act like this, okay? - It's just kind of fun to do - Slow down, girl.\nYou gonna eat that scone? - Damn it.\nSlow down.\nAre you-are you gonna have this scone? - Hey, man.\nHey, man.\nJust looking at my Garbage Pail Kids.\nJess makes me put 'em in a box.\nHow are you gonna put art like this in a box? What's going on with you? Nothing You will not tell Nick that you saw me here because then he'll get upset and I'm gonna have to move into my old room, and that means that we suck as a couple and that Abby was right and I cannot let that happen.\nJess went to a hotel because sharing a room with you is driving her crazy.\n(relieved moaning) Dude, at really was a tough one to keep in, but, honestly, I held my own and I did - my best.\nAre you kidding me?! I can't believe it! I changed in front of her! Sharing a room is driving you crazy, too.\nBut I didn't lie about it.\nI never get to win these things.\nSo, anyway, I just want to apologize.\nIt was wrong of me to get involved.\nAre you sure you don't want to tap Abby's phone? Run a DNA sample? I don't want to be coarse, but the bedroom is covered in it.\nI was worried about you, okay? I didn't want her to take advantage of you 'cause I know that you will do anything for the people that you care about.\nWell, I guess I could say the same thing about you.\nAnd, you know what, maybe Abby has changed.\nI'm thinking about helping Abby lease a storefront - for her jewelry.\nIs that crazy? - It's - (chuckles) It's amazing.\nDon't hold back.\nHere.\nHere, I want you to have this.\nOh.\nAbby made it.\nOh Mm It's a cough drop and - these are hard candies.\nI see that.\nI truly hate it.\nYou're welcome.\n(sighs) - Oh.\nOh, hey.\nHow was Sacramento? It was great.\nThe kids cried when they saw the capital.\nOh, did they? How many students showed up? - What hotel did you stay at? - Old Sacramento Inn.\nWhat room did you stay in? - 523.\nWhat floor was that on? - Five.\nWas there an elevator to the 4th floor? - 5th floor.\nSmoking or non-smoking? - Smoking.\nYou don't smoke.\nIn Sacramento, I do.\nWhat'd you have for breakfast? - Continental.\nHow are you this good at lying?! I know you're making this all up! I know you didn't go to Sacramento.\nI know you went to a hotel to be by yourself.\nDamn it, Winston! - Nick loved being alone, too! - Damn it, Winston! - That's for my ding-a-ling! You didn't like living together either? No, but it was your idea, and it seemed like the thing to do.\nBut at least I didn't lie about it, Jess.\nOkay, I did! But you were driving me crazy.\n(quietly): You wear a nightgown.\nAre you talking about my long shirt? You look like the Little Match Girl, wandering around Victorian England selling matches for a penny.\nI look like George Washington.\nI was just trying to be a good couple.\nSchmidt and Abby are doing it.\nWell, Schmidt and Abby are crazy.\nThey're doing a lot of things.\nWhy can't we do this?

I mean, Coach is in my room, and you guys are now moving in together.\nI'll just move into Jess' room.\nCool? - Yeah, but, like - Asking was just kind of a formality.\n'Cause my name's on the lease, so You guys are the best.\nOh (sighs) (chuckles) - Yay! - Yay.\nCool.\nGreat.\nLet's do this.\nWe can make it work.\nYou have to start washing your feet.\n"}, {"title": "03x19 - Fired Up.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nYou taking up tennis?

(Jess groans) I found some things and I put them on.\n(groans) Throw this on.\nMm.\nOkay.\nThat'll do it.\nCover up the tops.\nYou look great.\n(crying) - No.\nI couldn't have done it without you.\nNo, you're you're getting emotional.\nYou do this when you're hungover, but I'm gonna need you to stay focused so we can get to that party.\nYeah.\nWe just need the gift.\nYeah.\nI got the gift.\nAll right.\nWhy is it in the box? It's supposed to be out of the box, assembled.\nI said I would put it together before the party, and it's before the party.\nSo what's the problem? Just give me five minutes.\n(pieces clatter) Ten minutes, tops.\nBut I got this thing.\nThis is it.\nChristmas morning.\nOur little guy waiting by the fireplace, but there's no gift.\n'Cause Daddy's in the other room putting it together.\nDid you say \"our\" kid? Yeah, sometimes I think about what our kid would be like.\n(sniffles) Don't you? Yeah.\nYou don't think about the future? Can we not talk about this right now? Six hours ago, I was lapping cognac out of Winston's hands.\nDrink it up, Checkers.\nForget what you saw.\nNever talk about anything serious when you're hungover, Jess.\nI don't even really think about it that much.\nI just think about, you know, passing things.\nJust Nothing specific.\nWe live in a house by a lake.\nThat sounds pretty specific.\nWe live in a town with a sense of history but not so much history that the locals are suspicious of new people.\nTwo small children who are so incredibly creative they named themselves.\nWe don't need to discipline the kids 'cause they're so afraid of disappointing us.\nOur house smells like cider.\nAnd if there's a horse out back, you're not gonna get any guff from me.\nAnyway, that's where I'm at.\n(scoffs) What are you what are you thinking? What, um Where do you picture us? Where do you Nick.\nNick.\nMmm, mmm.\nOh, God.\nI still feel like crap.\nGuys, will you, um, look at this follow-up text that I'm sending to Buster? - It's for the little boy? - Try to be helpful, okay? - What are we looking at here? - Are those nursing cats? Winston said it was funny.\nIt's not.\nIt's incoherent.\nNo.\nIt's borderline pornographic.\n(sighs) Wait, those are not cats.\nThat's a human man! What is he suck What is he sucking on? - What Web sites are you going to? - What are you guys doing out here? Obviously we're creating an accidental bump-in with our hot new neighbors.\nElevator's on the move.\nYou got to go.\nYou're too hot.\nYou'll confuse them.\n(groans) (elevator dings) Yes, well, of course.\nIt's my garden party, and Zachary Quinto is not on the list.\nUm, you sure you can handle that, Winston? - I'm fine.\nI'm fine.\nOoh.\nAre you sure? Winston: I'm fine.\nI'm fine.\nTo the right a little bit.\nUp right.\nSon of a bitch.\nOkay.\nThank you so much.\nWe'll get you some nice cold lemonade after this, okay? Ooh, be careful.\nOh! Good Lord.\nYou know what, we don't have to talk about the future.\nLet's just put this toy together.\nI want to talk about the future.\nOkay.\nGreat.\nAll right.\nI would love to talk about it.\nYes, great.\nI always thought it would be cool to be a long-haul trucker.\nYou want to be a long-haul trucker with a family? No, the family would be in Montana.\nOr-or Mars Landing, you know, if the government finally steps up.\nWhere is Mars Landing? Where is Mars Landing? It's on M It's on Mars.\nIt's the American capital of Mars.\nAnd if you don't think there's gonna be space travel in the next 20 years, then you've got your head buried in sand, girlie.\nIt's already basically happening.\nI always thought I'd move back to Portland.\nOh.\nPortland, Earth? It's like friendly San Francisco.\nSlow food, fast bicycles, great schools Education is very important to me.\nThat makes me happy.\nIt's something we agree on.\nI really want my kids to beg for it.\nWhat? 'Cause if you force a kid into school, he's gonna hate it.\nOh, no.\nIf you make a kid work and sit in the yard and grind and grind - and grind - What? eventually, that little kid is gonna beg for education.\nThen you hand it to them - like the gift that it should be.\nNo! That's why public school's a joke.\nI'm so hungover and my body's shutting down and nothing you're saying makes any sense.\nThere is something serious I have to tell you about the future.\nThe name of my firstborn child has to be Reginald VelJohnson.\nI lost a bet to Schmidt.\nReginald VelJohnson? That is non-negotiable.\nUnfortunately.\nThe dad from Family Matters? Well, the actor who plays the dad.\nThe dad is Carl Winslow.\nWhat was the bet on? I said I could flip a big pancake (laughing): and I couldn't.\n(muffled): How is this going to work?! The only upside is the original name was gonna be Ass Baby, and I kind of talked my way out of that one.\nAll of the guys in this building are so sweet.\nIt's no problem, yeah.\nCouldn't be easier, really.\nJust a p piece of cake.\nCoach: We love it.\nYou know, it was my idea to help move.\nThe only reason we're doing this is because you forced us to.\nIf we don't help now, we'll look bad.\nYeah, now they're gonna think of us as \"nice\" and \"helpful.\n\" Nightmare.\nHey.\nHey.\nCoach: Oh, cool! Uh your brother? Actually, it's my boyfriend.\nYet he's not here to help you move.\nHe's out of the country.\nOh! Afghanistan.\nSecond tour.\nAh - Oh Please thank him for, - uh, for his service.\nYeah.\nAre you and your boyfriend and Michelle and her boyfriend gonna go on a, like, double date kind of thing whenever he gets back from Afghanistan? She doesn't have a boyfriend.\nShe's not really the relationship type.\nOh.\nOkay.\nI'm just having fun right now.\nI feel you.\nNo, I feel you.\n(laughs) Girl, I want to feel you And then there was one.\nMay the best man win.\nI am also involved in this.\nWinston, get out of here.\n\n\n\nWhat is your problem? And then there were three guys Jess: Here's what I'm saying: Reginald is way too shy to beg for an education.\nHe's very sensitive, and when he's out on the horse, all he's doing is staring at leaves and writing poems about them.\nWhy do I have a horse? You know how many people are killed on a horse every year? Hey! You're not listening to what I'm saying.\nWhat I'm saying is, I'm not gonna take Reginald out on the damn lake when you're out on your space truck - We're not living by the lake.\n(exasperated sigh) Why would I spend my hard-earned truck driver money on an Earth house? - You make up so much science fiction - Science but you know nothing about science.\nDo you know what science is? - Okay, science is more of a belief - than anything else.\nNo.\nDo you know what science is? - Yes.\nWhat you believe in.\nHave you ever taken a science class? I've taught two at a community college.\nWhen did you teach science at a community college? I made that up.\nI didn't think you were gonna fact-check me.\nMy kids are not gonna beg for an education, okay? They're gonna be forced to go to school just like everybody else and they're gonna hate it! Can I actually be very real with you for a second? - Yes.\nHere's what I really believe: You can create a plan for your life, and then crazy things get thrown at you, and that, by the way, is the closest thing that I have to a plan.\nSo maybe it's crazy to talk about being an intergalactic truck driver.\nBut what I think is crazier is trying to plan every single detail of our future.\nI think it's crazy not to.\nI just can't - live that way.\nI guess we just disagree.\nWell, we never agree on anything, ever, Nick.\nWhy are we doing this right now, Jess? We're hungover.\nJust because I want to know we're going in the same direction, - that we're on the same page.\nYes, we are.\nWell, we live on different planets! Oh You're talking about the fake future! I just I guess we want different things.\nClearly, we do.\nClearly, we do.\nAll right, so what are you saying? Should we just break up? (both laughing) Yeah, right.\nLike we're just - gonna break up! - Just break up! Over what? You don't like lakes, I don't like space.\nThat's okay! This is not why people break up! I break up with thee, sir! (bad Australian accent): I break up I don't do voices.\nI think I'm still drunk.\n(laughs) Let's just get to the party.\nBuild this toy and go.\nYeah.\nLet's do it.\nWe are an unstoppable toy-building team! Yes, we are.\nYeah.\nAll right, well, first hurdle: the instructions are written upside-down.\nAh, it's a false alarm.\nOkay, hit me.\nWhat do you got? Okay, take the thing - that looks like a meth lab - This thing? and put it in the thing that looks like a pipe bomb.\nOh, hey! - Hey! Now we're cooking with gas.\nWe're a good team.\nI agree.\nYou know what, Jess and if you want to move to Portland in the future, then we're gonna move to Portland.\nYou know, we'll live by the lake.\nI'll learn to fish, and me and Reginald will start a newsletter, you know \"Lake Father, Lake Son.\n\" And you know what? If you want to be a long-haul trucker, I can deal with that for six months, tops.\nYes! - Um, this piece is a little sticky, - but I think I can just jam it.\nAh! - What did you just do, Jess? - Oh.\nWell, I put the swastika in the guillotine.\nHow is this a children's toy? Why is it so brittle? What is that? I'm not sure what I've been doing.\n(sighs) Hey, Michelle.\nHey.\nYou guys are lifesavers.\nYou have beautiful taste, by the way.\nReally.\nIs this early Californian? You know, this color, actually, it symbolizes a woman's fertility.\nHuh.\nI was pregnant once.\nCool.\nWhat-what do you know? - Yeah.\nThank you, guys.\nNo, thank you.\nSo much.\nYou bet.\nAll right.\nTalk to you la - You see her blink at me? Wait, you think that was a sex blink? That wasn't a sex blink.\nThat was definitely a sex blink, dude.\nYou would not know a sex blink if it blinked you in the sex.\nWhat? - It's over already, man.\nYou don't have a shot.\n'Cause the chicks you pull are gremlins.\nYou did not just talk about my chicks.\nMy chicks look great.\nJust like me.\nI'm saying my chicks - literally look just like me.\nAll of 'em.\nIn varying color, but they look like me.\nThat is super awkward, and I don't feel like you know what - you're saying right now.\nWhoops! Oh Coach! Oh, man, I can't believe you just did that to her vase.\nWhoa! Dude! I will knock you out where you stand, and you in the ground.\nI will pound you from the side! I will pound you from the back! That sounded weird.\nOnce again, Schmidt has found himself in a position where he is infuriated! I will fight your face! I will freak out so hard on you right now, you don't even know, on your face.\nWinston: What are you two Oh, my goodness.\nGuys! Her study-abroad mirror? Her dream vase? Come on, guys.\n(huffs) Have some self-respect.\nWe're Nick: Hey, Jess? I don't think that belongs there.\nThat's why it doesn't fit in.\nWell, I don't think this water bottle goes here, either.\nBut you put it there.\nWell, why did we take the toy out of the box? We could have just given the box to the kid.\nWhat does he know? He's one.\nHe eats pennies.\nAnd he poos in his pants.\nBecause not putting the toy together is lazy.\nSo, if we can't put the toy together - I-I know, but it's not gonna fit.\nYou can't just keep pushing it because it Oh, God.\nOkay, where's the tape? - Oh, we used all the tape.\nOh, you used all the tape.\nYeah, to fix the things that you broke.\nYou used a lot of duct tape.\nActually you broke a lot of pieces.\n(laughs) All right, give it to me.\nI'm gonna use a lighter.\nAnd I'm gonna melt the plastic.\nI'm gonna weld it together.\nWhat? You don't think that's a good idea? No, you should, I think you should try it.\nI also like doing Zippo tricks.\nOw! Aah, I burned my finger! - What happened?! Are you okay? Yeah, it's fine.\nMy skin's a little bubbly.\nWell, I knew that was a bad idea.\nThen why didn't you say anything? Why didn't you put the toy together when I gave it to you two weeks ago? Because I'm not Santa Claus! I don't just put toys together two weeks in advance! And also, it's none of my business what they want to do with the toy.\nMaybe they want to return it.\nMaybe they want to put it together as a family.\nThat is not my business.\nWhat do you want from me, Jess? I just want you to take a little more responsibility.\nJust a little bit more.\nAnd I want you to have a little faith in me! I've gotten this far in my life.\nAnd I'm doing just fine.\nI mean, for the most part.\nThere's definitely a few blunders here and there that we could look past.\nWhatever The blanket's on fire! I can see that, Jess.\nGo get a bucket.\nWhere is it? In the kitchen? No, that's for meat.\nWe need a different bucket.\nOh, right! The famous meat bucket! You said the meat bucket was a brilliant idea! Why would I think an unrefrigerated bucket of meat was a good idea?! To taste what meat tasted like before electricity! Why would you want that?! Why did you say it was brilliant!? Because, Nick if I was always honest with you then we would never stop fighting.\n(smoke alarm beeping) - Let's go! - We have to go! Wait, my hat! What? My hat.\nSo sorry.\nI'm sorry.\nSo sorry.\nSorry.\nIt was uncool.\nI'm so sorry! Do you need? Here, do you want? Oh.\nHow did this happen? - It was Winston's fault.\nHe just ca he carries things wrong.\nWhat?! I have heard just about enough from you two.\nWhat? Ow! Schmidt: Winston! Girls, I know you're both smart enough to know exactly who broke your things.\nIt's the same two clowns who've been trying to sex Michelle every which way from Tuesday.\nI mean, I ain't gonna lie.\nI've been trying to sex you every which way from Tuesday myself.\nI'd be crazy not to, Michelle.\nYou're a very beautiful woman.\nYou have crazy witch eyes, and I dig it.\nYou're like a witch! (laughs) You know.\nBut I'm a good guy.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have a job to do.\nMy name is Winston Bishop.\nWelcome to the building.\nWhoa, Winston, I would not that's a - Winston, what are you doing? - That's a big (roars) - Okay.\nAah! - Oh! Whoa! - Son of a Winston, you do know that the building's on fire, right? I got this! Move, move! Buster: Cece, hey.\nOh, hey, um, I didn't think you would pick up the phone.\nI'll-I'll make this quick.\n'Cause I'm sure you hate talking on the phone.\nOh, I actually do.\n'Cause I'd much rather, um, talk in person.\nYou know? Face to face? (laughs) What are you doing here? I just, I was, uh, walking over here to see you.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd then you called me.\nDidn't all those texts really freak you out? Oh, no, no, no, no.\nThey freaked me out.\nI thought you were gonna murder me.\nYou know, I called my mother, changed my locks.\nThen I kind of, you know, had a change of heart, and I thought, \"Well, you know, I like this girl.\n\" I'd much rather just come and look at you with my eyes.\nAnd talk to you with my face.\nIf you ever got off the damn phone.\nYeah.\nRight? - I, mm-hmm.\nI understand.\nHi, Cece.\nHow are you? - Hungover? - Yes.\nWould you like to come and get some pancakes? Yeah, I could, I could use some pancakes.\nIt's gonna be a bouncy ride.\nMy kangaroo's around the corner.\n(laughs) But I did bring an extra helmet.\nYou're lucky.\n(grunts) All right.\nNick, why is this so hard? I don't want to fight all the time.\nI don't know, and it's awful.\nDo you ever miss when we were just friends, Jess? And there wasn't this pressure to be together and to be - Be different people? - Yes.\nBe different people.\nI'm sorry, but I'm not that guy who's gonna put the toy together.\nThat's just not me.\nI'm the kind of guy who's gonna leave it in the box.\nI don't want you to be that guy.\nI-I want you to be yourself.\nI want you to be yourself.\nAre we? (laughs): No! I love you! - Well, I love you, too.\nMore than I've ever loved anybody.\nBut what if that's the only thing we have in common? (sniffs) I miss my friend.\nI really miss my friend, too.\nSo, what does that mean? Are we? Yeah.\n(quiet laugh) (quietly): Earn this.\nWas that Saving Private Ryan? It was.\nIt was a hu-huge moment in that movie.\nAnd I just, I know this is a moment.\n(both laugh) So, um, I'll walk you to your room then, I guess.\n(sniffs) (sniffs) - Schmidt is living in my room.\nSchmidt's in your room, yeah.\nYeah.\nDo you think I could? - Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nIt's cool.\n(door shuts) Jess? Jess, you didn't have to run away.\nI don't know what you're so afraid of.\nIt's just a man doing full downward facing dog in the nude.\nIt's a couple of testicles just hanging upside down.\n(quiet laugh) I can hear you laughing in there.\nYeah, you liked it.\nYou telling Nick about it? What's he saying?\n"}, {"title": "03x21 - Big News.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n(groans) (sighs) \"You and Jess broke up.\" (sighs) Oh, man.\nThe bed got burned.\nI thought it was a dream.\nIt was a not a dream.\nI'm a little scared to see what's on the other side.\nWriting left-handed is HARB.\n(sighs) (spluttering) - Oh! - (shrieks) Goodness.\nHi.\nSorry.\nI was just changing in the closet, like Superman.\nAre we still allowed to see each other naked? - Yes.\nDo you think so? I don't know.\nHmm.\nMaybe.\nAh - Definitely not.\n(goofily): \"Derfi-niddley nit.\n\" (laughs) Boob season's over, for you.\nMind if I grab my socks? - Um, no.\nYou can go ahead.\nI'll close my eyes.\nOkay.\nHey! - Whoa! So how you doing? - I'm really good.\nGood.\nHow 'bout you? - Great.\nYeah, I'm really enjoying the breakup.\nYeah.\nI think I'm handling it well.\nYeah, you are.\nYou are.\nYou're.\nYou know, you're not drunk, you haven't left me And you're not crying while watching that movie Ghost.\nWell, it's Dirty Dancing.\nDoesn't Swayze do a dirty dance with that clay? That's not Dirty Dancing.\nIt's Ghost.\nIt's a different movie.\nWhich one takes place at camp? Dirty Dancing.\nWhich one's Whoopi in? Stop asking me questions about them.\nDrop it.\n(sniffs) So I saw this TV show about monkeys in India, and one of the monkeys, when it gets nervous and it wants to play submissive, it goes like this: And that lets all the other monkeys know it doesn't want trouble.\nThat's cool.\nThey also give each other oral pleasure.\nAnd they masturbate.\nSo what do we do now, Jess? Well, normally, I would go home, but I already am home, so - (laughs) - can't do that.\nI know where you live.\nAnd I live where you live.\nShould we tell the people we live with? - Yeah, let's do that.\nOkay.\nBad boys, bad boys What you gonna do What you gonna do when I come for you? Hey, you guys, we have, um Big news! I just got into the police academy.\n(laughing) Police naw give me no break - Not a solider mona give you no break - You know it.\nCoach: He knows it.\nBecause you are a cop.\nNo, my uncle was on Cops a bunch of times.\nHe got no residuals, though.\nHe's poor.\nThat really is big news! Big news.\nWhat a happy, happy day! Huzzah! And to celebrate, I'm gonna have a banquet in my honor.\nA banquet for yourself? That seems tacky.\nCan anyone here think of any reason why today should not be all about me? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Jess.\nSo I guess we're not telling anyone today.\nNah, it doesn't seem like the right move.\nYeah.\nSo we have to pretend to be a couple for one more day.\nIt's not that big of a deal.\nIt's gonna be easy.\nYeah.\nSo we broke up.\nWhat's the difference? Um I-I couldn't be more okay with it.\nWell, I couldn't be more okay, either.\nGreat.\nMe, too.\nCapital \"O,\" capital \"K\" capital \"A,\" capital \"Y.\n\" I'm okay.\n(crying): I'm not okay, Mom.\n(sniffling) I'm not okay.\nI'm not okay.\nI'm sorry to pull you out of your dance class.\nOh, the recital was today? I know we did the right thing, I just I feel like really upset, and Nick seems totally okay and I guess I just need someone to tell me it's gonna be fine.\n(sobbing): It's not gonna be fine, Jess.\nI'm never gonna be a grandmother! What? Mom Stop crying.\nYou don't even have to love him, honey.\nYou just have to get that sperm cooking! - Mom - I'm sorry, honey, I just You know, this is where I'm at right now.\nWell, this was really comforting, Mom.\n(Joan sobbing over phone) It's like I'm in the womb, sucking my thumb.\nLook, of course she doesn't know I'm in pain, Tran.\nI'm hiding it like you're supposed to.\nBut I'm lying to my best friend.\nYou're also my best friend, don't don't start that weird jazz train.\nI don't know how I'm gonna hold it all together.\nI can't talk about it with anyone all day.\nI feel like a pi\u00c3\u00b1ata, you know, and I'm just gonna pop.\nWhat does that mean: \"The problem is the solution?\" Oh, you mean just focus myself on Winston, and I won't have time to think about Jess.\nThat's really smart, but that's not exactly \"the problem is the solution.\n\" Do you know what I mean? That's, like, a cool sentence, but it's more just \"stay busy,\" right? Thanks, Tran.\nIf I'd met you in your prime, during the war, that would have been glorious! But then we would've been enemies and tried to murder one another, unless we formed an alliance.\nOh You and me forming an alliance in an old-school war? That's a fantasy.\nOr a novel.\nYou just gave me another idea.\nWinston? I've been thinking about it, and a banquet is not big enough.\nYou're not retiring from some insurance company.\nSo what do you really want, besides a pi\u00c3\u00b1ata? Dream big.\nDream big, he said.\nOkay.\nUm If I had my druthers you know, 100% of my druthers I I gotta go Honey Roast.\nThe hell is that? And don't say it like it's some thing we know! It's a roast, except you say nice things about me.\nHoney Roast.\nHuh.\nYou know? Well, I can't wait to make that happen for you.\nYou serious? - He thinks you're serious.\nHow do I do it? - You just get everybody to say a bunch of cute stuff about me.\nYou know, all the, like, funny stuff that makes me sweet, you know? Done! What else? What? There's There's more? (laughs) Uh make me a prominent chair.\nLike a throne? - Come on.\nA throne? Who am I, CeeLo? (laughs) No, I just This is me, I'm still the same person.\nStop touching me.\nI'm not gonna change.\nI'm still the same person.\nStop touching me.\nSo make me a prominent chair.\nThen you shall have that, Winston.\nWhat else you want? I'm thinking maybe you should MC my roast.\nOkay, I will.\nAnd can you do it dressed as Furguson? I'm not gonna do that.\nThought it might be special.\nNah, it's strange.\nAll right, I'm gonna get started on that chair.\nSchmidt: Well, this just in: the dress code for Winston's banquet tonight is is opt is optional.\nWhy would he write \"optional\" there? That's gotta be a mistake, right? And they're gonna give him a gun? What are you doing back there? Thought it was about time I graduated high school.\nMmm - I'm proud of you.\nThat's it? No snide comments? I've got legions.\nBut I'm gonna be supportive.\n\"Legions\" means \"a lot.\n\" I know what \"legions\" means.\nAnyway, I probably won't even take the test.\nI failed the last five practice exams.\nSo that seems like a bad sign.\nOf course you're failing.\nYou're studying here in a rowdy tavern.\nChumbawamba's playing, it's not even \"Tubthumping.\n\" You're writing with what looks to be a golf pencil.\nWhere are your flash cards? Do you not have o-one single flash card? There's maraschino goo everywhere! You don't have a flash card? I'm taking over.\nYou need a tutor.\nYes, I'll do it.\nYou realize I have a boyfriend, right? Oh, the hunky Australian boy? Congratulations.\nCece, this is about your education.\nNothing more.\nMm.\nHe's actually from Perth, so Perth is in Australia, Cece.\nWe'll start with geography.\nOh, Cece, I really need to ask Schmidt if my outfit's working.\nIt is not.\nI was in the middle of tutoring Cece! - Make it quick! - I know why you're upset, okay? I should've asked you to tutor me.\nBut he just volunteered, and I figured you'd be busy with Nick.\nWell, I'm not busy with Nick anymore.\nOh, no.\nDid you guys break up? Jess, are you pregnant? I feel like I made it weird with the pregnancy thing, you guys.\nDid I make it weird with the pregnancy thing? 'Cause I really feel like I did.\nI feel like, in my heart, that that was a that was the wrong to say, especially to two women who are sitting alone in a room together.\nYou know, I don't know where you guys are at with your lives But you're certainly getting up to an age where babies are on your mind, and-and I didn't want to throw that into the mix.\nI could see that you were emotional, Jess, when you left, and I, and I don't want to make you more emotional by bringing up pregnancy.\nAnd, Cece, you can probably barely spell \"pregnancy.\n\" And I feel terrible.\nAre you frickin' razzing me in there? Did I just here a razz? Damn it! So you're really building Winston's throne, huh? It's a prominent chair.\nAnd it's not right! It's not regal enough! - How long have you been doing this? - It's for the Honey Roast.\nI'm trying to think of cute things to say about Winston.\nI got great stuff about his feet.\nWhat are you saying, dude? You sound insane.\nIf anything's cute about Winston, it's his yawn.\n(yawning) He goes, like (both imitating Winston's yawn) - Can I use that? - You're scaring me, man.\nLike, for real.\nLike, I'm scared for you.\nDon't do that voice 'cause it makes me confess things.\nI'm really scared for you.\nI broke up with Jess.\nYou broke - You broke up with Jess?! - (quietly): I broke up with Jess.\nAw, man.\nIt's real.\nOr she broke up with me, I don't know, but we're broken up.\nWell, at least that explains all of that.\nKind of.\nI just feel like I'm falling apart.\nLike, my brain feels like spaghetti.\nAnd my future feels like a dark hole that I can't stop falling down.\nYou can't show her this pain.\nOr she'll freak out and it'll be over, okay? I wish someone would've told me that when Malia and I broke up.\n(crying): Malia, I'm in pain and I want you to know! (sobbing) I want to get this pain out of my body! (retching) I haven't seen her since.\nI still read her e-mails, though.\nEvery day.\nEvery day.\nEvery damn day.\nEvery day.\nYou have to hide your feelings no matter what.\nAnd I am.\nShe thinks I'm okay.\nThat's my game plan.\nI'm talking about pills, man.\nSchmidt's got some anxiety pills in his top drawer, you know? - That's a great idea.\nDo it.\nDon't tell any of the roommates about the breakup.\nThought I made it clear that I do not want to talk about this.\nSure.\nHe just seemed so fine with it.\nLike he's happier than me watching Coach watching Winston yawn.\n(yawning) I'm sure he's just as sad as you are.\nIt's an act.\nYou need to go and talk to him so he can tell you how he really feels.\nI'll go with you, okay? - Thanks.\nOf course.\nAre you guys Frenching? Okay, say you're Frenching and I'll stop knocking.\nIgnore him, okay? Just ignore him.\nRemember Cece, no one knows we broke up.\nNot a word.\nNope.\nHey! - Come here, you.\nWhy are we doing this? Uh this is, uh, how I, how I greet everyone now.\nAnd then I, uh, do this.\nThen do that.\nOh.\nAnd top it off with a little bit of that.\nYou feel me? This is how you greet everybody now? Ah, come here, you.\nUh, that wasn't an invitation.\nNick, hi! Son of a bitch! Come here, you.\nWhat are you doing, man? - You take the pills? - Uh, I feel as if I'm of cotton.\nSorry for what's about to happen.\n(grunts) (whispers a blessing) Do you have a minute to maybe have a conversation with your sweet, sweet girlfriend? I think the only way we're gonna get through this is if we're really honest with each other about how we're really feeling.\n\n\n\nThis morning I told you I was okay, and Why are you winking at me? - Am I winking? - Yeah.\nI think I'm just a little nervous.\nI'm gonna put my sunglasses on so we can keep talking.\nOkay, okay.\n'Cause I don't think I can stop this.\nPlease continue with what you were saying.\nUm, I just, um, want you to tell me how you really feel.\nGreat.\nGre I'm sorry, \"Great\"? - I feel great.\nIs great the, the, uh, is the emotion you feel right now? - No.\nOh.\nI feel amazing.\n(laughs) - \"Amazing\"? - Yeah.\nYou feel amazing right now? I just feel happier and amazing and lighter.\nTonight's about Winston.\nYou don't have to worry about me 'cause I'm worried about the Honey Roast.\nI'm sorry I forgot that Winston is the most important thing that's going on today.\nThat's where I'm putting all my energies.\nFan tastic.\nTook a long time to say that word.\nThere you are! (groans) - We're supposed to be studying.\nCome here, you.\nAh, thanks, Coach.\nI needed this.\nMm.\nDelightful.\nTo you, too, my friend.\nThat is super weird.\nWhat is wrong with you? What are you scared of a couple practice tests? Just something more important came up, that's all.\nThere should be nothing more important to you, Cece, than your future.\nBecause nothing is more important to me than your future.\nDo you know how stupid it makes me feel to care more about your future than you do? Nick and Jess broke up.\n(Coach laughs) I knew you knew! - Oh! - I knew it! So, you knew, too.\nBut you knew and you told.\nLook, that was so sweet of you, Schmidt.\nOkay? And thank you for believing in me - Who gives a rat's A?! - Hmm? Nick and Jess break up.\nand you spring this on me like a, like it's a freaking weather report? I am a child of divorce! I'm delicate! Should've graduated the first time around, you buffoon! Better keep it together, dude.\nNo one can know you know.\nJess: Guess what, Cece? (door closes) My boyfriend Nick is totally frickin' fine.\nHe's actually, he's \"amazing.\n\" Okay, wine.\nYeah, make it a big one.\nA holiday pour.\n'Cause today's all about Winston.\nNick: Yeah, it's all about Winston.\nSomebody say Winston? - Whoa! - What? Guys, I gotta say, I am walking on air, I really am.\nIt's, uh Excuse me for a second.\nHey, Winston! Hey, it's your day! I'm diving in! What can I do? 'Cause today is all about Winston.\nYeah, all about Winston.\nWhatever you want, buddy.\nMm-hmm.\nAnything? My name is Nick Miller and I'm your host of tonight's Honey Roast.\nWinston: Thank you! Thank you! And I'm Furguson the cat.\nYa-ya! Okay, uh, tonight's Honey Roast, we're gonna keep it sweet, keep it positive, and most of all, we're gonna keep it cute.\nAm I right, Furguson? Hope that cat's not driving.\nHow is a cat costume just lying around? She has four of them.\nI'm drinking a \"Catbernet.\n\" - (laughs) - That's pretty good.\nOkay.\nThat's pretty good.\nA Pinot \"meowoir\" Meow-oi-rr.\nIf I have one more of these, you're gonna have to point this old kitty in the direction of my litter box because I'm gonna need to find it.\nMm, let's keep it cute, guys.\n'Cause I'm gonna have to pee.\nSpeaking of cute, Winston Bishop is so cute All: How cute is he? How cute am I? Teddy bears buy Winston for their kids.\nThat was good.\nThat is exactly how cute I am.\nHorrible visual.\nWant to know how cute you are? Yeah, I want to know how cute I am.\nYou want to know how cute you are? I want to know how cute I am.\nPuppys put him Not gonna do that one.\nAre we still pretending that we don't - Relax.\nKeep it together.\nMm-hmm, it'll be over soon.\nPretend like you're enjoying this.\nSmile.\nMm-hmm.\nWinston is so cute, he once met a Japanese gal named Ariko, and she started wearing him as a backpack! (both laugh) Boom! Ooh! I did not see that one coming! Oh, my! - I didn't expect it either.\nSurprise ending! I think it's time, I think it's time that this cat takes over.\nWhy hold back? I feel like we should make this - a real roast.\nYeah.\nDon't do that.\nMm, mm-mm, mm-mm.\nI'm kind of scared, but I'm also kind of excited.\nI think, actually, it's my turn to - It's my turn! - Uh mm-mm.\nOkay, back here.\nThis is the best idea.\nI think I should sit down.\nGetting a little mean.\n(laughs) Time to add some honey.\nWho's in the house? Coach is in the house.\nWhat-what? What's up, Coach? You have so many sweatpants, you need to buy normal pants.\n(laughs) Cece here.\nYou guys know Cece.\nYour hair's so long.\nWell, you're basically busted.\nGood one.\nThat was good.\nThat was really a good one.\nThat was a good one.\nSchmidt - Jess, please, don't.\nI'm very fragile right now.\nYour head's so big.\n(laughing) That actually wasn't that bad.\nYou got a big-ass head, dude! And Nick Miller Oh, boy.\nWhat can I say about Nick that hasn't already been said? Oh, here we go.\nNick calls birds \"wind mice.\n\" Nick: Think about it.\nNick says \"Yahtzee\" when he climaxes.\nOh, boy.\nHe calls turtles \"shell beavers.\n\" Well, that's what they should be called.\nJess: They're green.\nBeavers are brown.\nWe've had this argument and we have agreed to not talk about it in front of others.\nBut you know the worst, worst, worst thing about Nick? - You don't have to say it.\nYou just - Mm-mm, mm-mm.\nHe's okay.\nHe's okay.\nAnd I am not okay.\n(sniffles) I'm not okay.\nWhat are you talking about? Are you nuts? I'm falling apart.\nYeah, I I'm on Schmidt's anti-anxiety medicine.\nWhat?! (laughs) Nick: Yeah, I stole it from his drawer.\nSchmidty's little helpers.\nOoh.\nSorry about that.\nI'm very much not okay! I was only acting okay 'cause I thought you were okay.\nI'm not okay.\nI am not okay.\nI'm terrible! I know I'm smiling right now, but I feel terrible.\nI'm so happy - Yeah.\nthat you feel terrible.\nIt's a devastating breakup.\nYou know, I know we lived together.\nIt's really hard.\nIt's tricky, you know? - Yeah.\nYou know, it sucks.\nI really thought we had a future.\nMe, too.\nYeah, saw the whole thing, the whole thing.\nAnd now we don't.\nIt's done, yeah.\nWe have nothing in common.\n(laughs) Yeah.\nI also can't stop smiling because of the drugs, so my face feels crazy.\nIt feels like I had plastic surgery.\nWinston: Can somebody please tell me what the hell is going on in here? - You want to do this? - I think we should.\nBoth: We broke up! - We're done.\nIt's over.\nIt's all done.\nAre you serious?! What?! - What?! No! Come on, guys, it's so obvious.\nSon of a bee sting.\nI mean What, you broke up today? - Yesterday.\nYesterday.\nWell, why didn't you tell me? Because we didn't want to ruin your day.\nAnd I'm so sorry we did.\nWe're so proud of you that you got into the police academy, but we're just, we're in a really bad zone.\nYeah, a too bad zone.\nSo let's just come out and admit it.\nWe're in a terrible zone.\nAre you kidding me? Something this big happens and you guys still look out for me? I mean, that's Thank you.\nI really appreciate it, you guys, but I'm here for whatever you need.\nThank you, buddy.\nLook, I know this is super weird and definitely high on anxiety pills but I'd like everybody to hold hands in this moment.\nNo.\nJust do it, man.\nThat's it.\nEverybody? - Oh.\nIt's two ladies.\nI'm okay.\nThis feels good.\nOm (all humming) (humming stops) Let's never tell anyone we did this.\nShould we all try to live inside a peach, or is that weird? Guys, in light of what's been going on, I will be postponing the Honey Roast - until tomorrow night.\nOkay.\nAh! - No.\nCoach: No way.\nSchmidt: Not doing this.\nWe could say everybody come back, - Sorry, Winston.\neverybody come back the same time, so then you guys all get to wear white.\nHungry eyes (phone ringing) One look at you And I can't disguise I've got hungry eyes Hi, again.\nI feel the magic (mutes audio) I'm watching Dirty Dancing.\nI know.\nI've heard all three screenings.\nI just don't understand how Penny got in trouble.\nWell, you know, it was a different time.\nWho wins in a fight? Swayze from Dirty Dancing or Swayze from Roadhouse? I think, uh, To Wong Foo Swayze would win.\nJess, this is really hard.\nI don't know what to do.\nI don't know what to call you.\nIt's like a riddle.\nI know! I don't know where to change or where to sleep or where to go to the bathroom.\nWell, I know where to go to the bathroom.\nBut you know, the social component.\n(sniffles) (chuckles) Oh, no.\nI'm out of tissues.\nNick: I got it.\nHeads up! Oh! Hey.\nThank you.\nNick: No problem.\nThat's what I'm here for.\nGood night, honey.\nGood night.\nWith these (sings along): Hungry eyes One look at you and I can't disguise (Nick joins in): guise, I got hungry eyes\n"}, {"title": "03x22 - Dance.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThanks for helping me with my school dance.\n\"Love is forever, and ever, and ever, and\" - How many \"and ever\"s? - Technically infinity, but I could only fit 12.\nWell, this is going to be tough for you, huh? Yes! Foster said we couldn't afford it, but I really stuck my neck out for this dance.\nNo, I-I mean because the theme of the dance is \"Love is forever\" and Nick, and the breakup What? No, Cece, look, you remember what school dances were like for me.\nThey were miserable.\nI was just waiting in the bathroom for to magically appear and ask me out.\nI remember.\nI was smoking in the stall next to you.\nWe get it, you were bad.\nI just don't want it to be like it was for me.\nI want them to have an incredible time.\nMy life is a bit of a mess right now, but the one thing I can do is throw an amazing dance for them.\n\"Love is forever, and ever, and ever\" - What is this? - The theme of Jess's school dance.\nIt's pretty ironic, huh? - Jess, you poor thing.\nCome-come here.\nCome here.\nWhat? What? Just there.\nWhat are you doing? - All right.\nUh-huh.\nOkay.\nOh, I know.\nI know.\nI know.\nWhat's happening?

You see? I'm proud of you.\nThat's what I'm talking about.\nWe're men.\nWe've felt pain, we've survived it.\nLook at me.\nI'm watching Cece drool over some 20-year-old.\nHow could she be interested in a boy when she could have these ripe berries? Look at these, Nick.\nPut your towel down.\nOh, God, I need a shvitz.\nWhy does my sweat smell like asparagus? He does take all the sexual tension out of a room.\nMan, I heat up every room I walk into.\nPut me next to a dozen eggs.\nThey hatching.\nYou know why? 'Cause I got the heat of a mother hen.\nThere was no sexual tension in here before he got here.\nKeep telling yourself that, Nick.\nCongrats, chaperones! With your help, tonight is going to be unforgettable.\nI didn't sign up for this.\nNo, you didn't.\nNone of you did.\nIn fact, none of you have ever, ever signed up for any school event, ever.\nWhich means you've never felt the joy of exchanging your free time for a child's smile.\nI never volunteer because of my Munchausen syndrome.\nAre we getting paid? You will get paid, um, actually, in attractive hats that I made.\nThey say \"chaperone.\n\" And Gary the Janitor has one that says \"clean up crew.\n\" You call me Gary the Janitor as if me being a janitor is my whole identity.\nIt's like someone calling you Jess the Third-Hottest White Teacher.\nOkay.\nAre we done? I'm gonna say we're done.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nThank-thanks, guys.\nGood-good meeting.\nI don't know where I'm supposed to be right now.\nThanks, guys.\nIt's gonna be great!

Let me go, let me go, let me go.\nUm, check this out.\nCece's boyfriend is so young that It'll come back to me.\nBuster is more of a man than all of you.\nOkay? He's been to, like, 40 countries, he builds boats, he used to train snakes with his uncle.\nEarning a respectable wage, wearing a proper-hanging pair of slacks, ordering sushi like a sick-ass boss - These things a man maketh.\nSo stupid stuff that you do.\nI know that technically you guys are men, but all you do is hang out with each other, like you're 12.\nWhat do you know? You're just a stupid girl.\nOkay, I got it, I got it.\nOkay, Cece's boyfriend is so young that - How-how young is he? - Winston.\nIt's not working, man.\nI'm serious.\nI'm at my wit's end with you.\nWhat? Wait a minute.\nWhy's the door locked? The dance starts in five minutes.\nOkay.\nGary! Thank God you're here.\nCan you unlock the door? No.\nI didn't put that there.\nWhat? Who else could have done it? We can't start the dance if the door's locked.\nDon't tell me I wore my raw denim for no reason.\nDon't you dare tell me that! I am not telling you that.\nSo the dance is cancelled, then? No, no, no.\nThere is gonna be a dance.\nIt's gonna be great and perfect and lovely and it will celebrate love is forever and ever and ever.\nWhere are you guys going?

Yes! Everything's back on track, guys! This bike lock was a real punk move.\nSeems like there's a lot of punks here.\nDid you do this? - Hey.\nYou did this? Huh?

You have no idea what these little bastards are capable of.\nI mean, I love them.\nI love them with all my heart.\nBut they will hurt your feelings sometimes.\nHe's right.\nI remember sticks and stones may break your bones, but not if you're a fat kid with calcium deficiency.\nSchmidt, you're on snack table duty.\nKeep the chip bowls full.\nDon't let the kids spike the punch.\nAnd make sure Diabetic Amy only has four cookies.\nDiabetic Amy ain't gonna get no cookies on my watch.\nNo, she-she has to have at least two or she'll pass out.\nShe's getting nothing as far as I'm concerned.\nAt least two, at least two or she'll pass out.\nAll right, Winston?

I'm really sorry.\nI wanted this to be a great vacation for you guys.\nBut look, we split up the ship: I took starboard, he took the other one.\nI got the starboard and she got the other side.\nWhat are you doing, man? You're hanging out by an exhaust vent.\nIt keeps the left side of my face warm and it sounds like the ocean.\nMore than the ocean sounds like the ocean? Come on, Nick.\nYou guys can't be separate the whole trip.\nThe trip just made it clear.\nThe breakup's too hard.\nI don't think we can be friends for a while.\nWhat? You're not gonna be friends with Jess?

The opportunity has not presented itself as I'd hoped it would, so I'm creating it now.\nWhen I say, \"May our progeny bathe in the infinite glow,\" that's your cue.\nNow, what what did I just say? You repeat it so I know that you know the cue.\nMay our pro what? What's wrong with you? Unbelievable.\nI don't know what you're saying.\nI'll just say, \"go,\" okay? When I say, \"go,\" you start to play.\nAnd before she sees, just get behind get behind the vent.\nGet behind the vent.\n(Clears throat) Cece Hmm? Hey.\nUm, your hair in the moonlight It looks so shiny.\nYou know, I'm trying to get a signal so I can talk to Buster, but it's just impossible out here.\nIn the moonlight, your eyes, they sparkle like, like fish eyes.\nI got one.\nNow, like, what, do I have to hold it at this angle the whole time? Why is it so important for you to get in touch with Buster? (Sighs) Look, you know better than anyone that I don't have the best of luck with relationships.\nAnd I know you think he's young for me.\nI don't.\nI just want you to be happy.\nThank you.\n\n\n\nWinston: Guys, guys! You got to come with me right now.\nBe warned, though.\nThere is a weird guy with a violin hiding behind this vent.\nA what? Dude! (Groans) - What's going on? - Come on right.\nI will I will knock you out where you stand, sir.\nGet back there.\nThey're gonna take a break from being friends for a while? What does that even mean? Guys, this is on us.\nWe're the ones who put the pressure on them to not be weird.\nI know.\nWhat were we thinking? Of course they're gonna be weird.\nThey just broke up.\nHey, that's on y'all.\nI-I have nothing to do with that.\nI've just been chilling in the room.\nHanging out, singing songs.\nYou are safe in the room You are safe, you will live I've been trying to get them to talk to each other all morning, okay?

That's what they It's funny, that's what they say when I You know who they will listen to, though? - A doctor.\nThe president! - The ca What were you - What were you gonna say? - The captain.\nThe captain.\n(Over p.\nA.\n): Attention, this is your captain.\nWould Nick Miller and Jessica Day please return to their stateroom for a non-life-threatening but necessary official maritime reason.\nThis is not an emergency.\nIt is definitely not.\nHey! Did you hear the captain? Yes! Go, go, go! (All clamoring) Everybody inside! This is not a drill! Okay! Okay, the door is locked.\nThe \"Do not disturb\" sign has been employed.\nWe are not leaving here until you guys are friends again.\nWe just wanted to spend our vacation alone.\nYes.\nOn separate strange parts of this ship.\nYeah, it's I really wanted to see how the ship worked.\nI think it's interesting.\nAnd I really wanted to see how the other side of the ship worked.\nYeah.\nIt's interesting.\nWe should've never asked you guys not to be weird around us.\nMm-hmm.\nWe-we want you to be weird around us.\nYeah.\nJust let us in.\nOpen your cellar doors, and let us taste your jams.\nYou want to \"taste our jams\"? - Again, you have lost me.\nListen to yourself for once in your life.\nJess: It's my jam and you can't have it.\nFirst of all, that's my ex-girlfriend's jam, dude.\nI put a ban on jam.\nOkay, you know what? All of us are weird.\nBut we're all still friends.\nSo, let's talk about it.\nI'll go first.\nI've made out with half of the guys in this room.\nOkay.\nThat's a start.\nAll right.\nThat's a start.\nAnd I have had nightmares about making out with the other two guys in this room.\nSo, yourself? - And me.\nNick and Winston.\nCece: Okay.\nOkay.\nIt's good for you to finally admit that.\nI respect that.\nYeah, thanks for sharing.\nUm, it really bums me out that I'll never know the infinite joy of what it feels like to carry a child inside of me.\nWow.\nOkay, Coach! That's honesty.\nThat's real honest.\nThat's how it's done.\nOkay, um Here we go, up we go.\nI feel like it is really weird that I live with my ex-boyfriend.\nSee? There you go! - Nice! Just turn on the tap.\nYou know, let it out.\nReally nice.\nThat was cool that you admitted that.\nI feel weird about living with my ex-girlfriend.\nYeah.\nYou know, I think it's a landmine for trouble.\nWhat's gonna happen when other hunks come around? What's gonna happen when you bring some ho-bag in the house? Exactly! Like, that it's scary stuff, and I feel like when a breakup happens, you mostly get away.\n'Cause I'm gonna beat her ass.\nWhat if she's bigger than you? She probably will be.\n(Laughs): Oh, snap! That was good.\n(All laughing) Good for you! Yeah! I saw that, man.\nThat's how it all starts.\nThis is how it starts.\nGood.\nThat's good, man, that's really good.\nYeah.\nWell, it's nice to talk to you about this.\nYeah, it was really weird when you Tried to kiss me last night, (Groans) And you licked my ear.\nWhat?!

It's like hoof.\nThere's nothing on my hand. This is a regular old hand...\nI'm out, I'm out. You're out of what?\nFour-way. Done. No way.\nNot with that thing.\nYou're a buffoon.\nThat is ridiculous.\nI was only doing it for you, Schmidt, so you don't freak out when you find out that CeCe's single.\nAnd now I'm the weirdo with the hoof hand.\nWhat... take it back from the hoof hand.\nWhat'd you say before? About CeCe being single?\nHow do you know that?\nShe's single?\nI have my, uh... assumptions.\nSo CeCe's single now.\nYou don't know that for sure.\nThat's interesting.\nWhy are you so calm?\nInteresting.\nDon't just say \"interesting.\"\nThat's interesting.\nIf you're gonna say \"interesting\" say why it's interesting.\nIt is interesting.\n(Screams)\nAah!\nNick!\nWhat are you doing here?\nWhat are you doing here?\nIt's the men's room!\nMmm...\nJess, scooch over. All right.\n(Groans)\nWhat are you doing? Just hiding in the bathroom?\nKind of.\n(Laughs)\n(Laughs) Me, too.\nI know I'm supposed to, like, \"get back out there,\" you know? But...\nMaybe I'm just not built for it.\nMan, I hear you.\nSidebar: What do my hands feel like?\nHooves.\nAw, son of a...\nMaybe there's a reason I'm not up on a fridge, you know?\nMaybe some people are fridge people, and other people are... toilet people.\nYou think you're a toilet person?\n(Laughing) You're not a toilet person.\nYou want to get on the fridge, you'll get on the fridge, Jess.\nJust be yourself, and if he's not into Jessica Day, then there's something wrong with him.\nBe myself.\nLike do my Tina Turner impression?\nHow did your brain jump there?\n What's love got to do \n got to do with it? \n(Laughs)\n(Laughs) All right.\nI hear your logic.\nCome on.\nNo man wants that, but... you can't quit, either.\nYou're our last hope.\nYou're the only one out of the group who might not go home alone tonight, Jess.\nReally?\nYes.\nIt's all on your shoulders.\nSo the sex fist... has... turned into a sex finger.\nUh, don't... yeah.\nsex finger.\nHey. Ted. Um...\n(Clears throat) I'm out of moves, so...\nI'm just gonna try being myself.\nHere's some stuff about me: I've never cured anything.\nI'm a middle school vice principal and I love my job.\nUm, I'm just getting out of a relationship with a guy that I still live with, which is kind of complicated.\nHe's over there.\nWhat's up, Nick?\nHi, I'm Nick!\nSometimes I cry when newscasters wish each other \"Happy Birthday\" on air.\nMy first crush was on a Batman cake, but my first sexual feelings were about teenage Simba.\n'Cause he was super hot, and I still, actually, find him hot.\nUh, truth time. Um...\nSo that's me.\nAnd if you want to take me home, Ted, we can definitely do some no-bra stuff.\nUh...\nThat's me naked.\nWell...\n...and this is me with a guy who I thought was Larry king.\nSo it's decision time.\nYeah, Ted, who's it gonna be?\nMe or Jess?\n(Sighs)\nHmm?\nTed: Ooh...\nTed: Wow. Hah.\nOoh...\nThis is tough.\nI mean, okay, 'cause I mean, over here we've got, you know, the whole... you know.\nAnd then, but of course over here we got the... bing, and the... you know.\nMmm...\n(Groaning): Oh, God, what do I do?\nWhat do I do?\nIt's over.\nMoment's passed, Ted.\nOkay.\nI'll take him out.\nSo you and Buster broke up.\nWhew. I'm sorry.\nYeah, I'm just waiting for you to do something weird now.\nYeah, I feel that coming on, so, um...\nI'm gonna go.\n(Sighs heavily)\nYou know what doesn't whine and cry is the sperm in my freezer.\nI am counting down the days until we don't need men to procreate.\nIf I really put my mind to it...\nAutumn 2018.\nAre you ready?\nOh, it's my plan \"b.\"\nYeah. Beats going home alone.\nJust giving her a ride.\nNothing weird.\n(Whispering): We do this every time.\nSo, Katherine, uh...

Now, I'm gonna say something, and you tell me what's really being said.\nOh, you know, I'm just staying in a hotel right now.\nI like to travel.\n(buzzing)\nHomeless.

I set you up on ten dates.\nWhat?\nTen years of experience in one day.\nExpert by midnight.\nThe Dice Diez.\nDiez is Spanish for ten.\nAre you insane, Schmidt? I'm not ready.\nThat's like taking a musical from rehearsals straight to Broadway. You got to workshop it first...\nIf you are for one second suggesting that I don't know how to open a musical...\nHow dare you? I'm trying to help you out here.\nNow, of course you're not ready, Jess.\nThat's why I set up ten dates.\nNow, you can do this. Come on.\nAll right.\nSo...\nSo.\nDate talk.\nOkay. (chuckles) What do you do?\nUm, well, I don't have a job, currently, right now, in the traditional nine to five sense, but, uh, I got a lot cooking.\nI grow raisins.\nI'm sorry, Malcolm, um, I'm gonna have to... (whispering): Get out of there. let you finish that story.\nOh, okay. I grow two types of raisins.\nThere's the Leopold raisin, which is from Austria.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd then there's the Zwiebel raisin, which is also from Austria.\nBut I think the main thing that got me through my time in prison was the realization that a raisin can be anything.\nWe got to go!\n(in Southern accent): Ma called. The bees are back.\nMa called. The bees are back.\nOh, okay. Um...\nShould I just... Should I wait for you?\nYou know that was a bad date, right?\nI know, but I just felt so trapped.\nJust do what I did, make up an excuse and then leave.\nJust, just say as little as you need to, okay?\nMake it your own.\nYou ready? Yeah.\nYou can do this.\nOkay.\n\nYou have so much hair. What?\nWhere did all that hair come from?\nYou're like a lioness.\nSo, did you know you could put a whole live chicken in your mouth and eat it without plucking it or preparing it at all?\n(whispering): Keep it simple.\nUh, let's keep it simple.\nYou're a nice guy, and that's a neat outfit.\nAre you a chef? Are you a beatnik?\nAre... Do you work on... on a submarine?\nShh.\nNo! No!\nOh. Stand down, sir!\nWe found your son.\nHe's alive.\nThey found my son; he's alive.\nI'm sorry.

There's Dugan.\nThat's the guy I was telling you about. Come on.\nOver there is better.\nAll right.\nWhat?\nWhatever the hell that means.\nIs there a cop in the house? (laughs)\nI feel really calm. Really relaxed.\nOh, look, a hummingbird.\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\nThere's no such thing as a hummingbird.\nBirds don't hum.\nThey sing.\nThey basically invented singing.\nYou're so high right now, man.\nYou're so high, I couldn't possibly even bring you back.\nActually, dude, I feel really good.\nHey, hey, hey, hey, when you walk, you look like an insane person.\nOkay? And your voice sounds so stoned and crazy.\nSay something.\nHello, Nick.\n(laughs)\nThat took you, like, 20 minutes.\nHello, Nick.\nAnd now I'm a model and a bartender.\nBut I...\nI'm not sure what's next. I feel a little lost.\nI'm not exactly sure what I'm doing with my life.\nI'm so sorry.\nWhat was your question again?\nI didn't ask you anything.\nYou just walked up and started talking.\nSo, man, I'm in the locker room, and I see a spider, and I'm like, I hope this is Charlotte's Web and you're nice.\nYou haven't seen Charlotte's Web?\nCharlotte's Web, the, uh, cartoon.\nThe tale about the spider who was super chill and super cool.\nThen, well, series of events, she ended up dying.\nSo that was sad.\nThat was sad, but spoiler alert, if you haven't seen it.\nI'm sure you... You haven't seen it.\nWhere are my dogs?\nI took the liberty of writing down some exit lines, because obviously, you can't come up with any on your own.\nHere, take a look at those.\nI've got hockey practice?\nSure.\nMy boss is trying to contact me about a project that could save the company.\nMm-hmm.\nSchmidt, these are such obvious rejections.\nI don't want to hurt their feelings.\nHurt their feel...\nDo you just walk around all day thinking about other people's feelings?\nYeah. Don't you?\nNo.\nHow do you get anything done?\nIt's hard.\nOkay, Jess, how can I put this?\nYou're the prize here.\nOkay?\nYou are the last piece of pie, and all of these guys are the fat kids in the cafeteria, and I can say that because I used to be fat as a truck.\nYou really think I'm the last piece of pie?\nDamn right you're the last piece of pie.\nYou're the best girl on Dice, Jess.\nAnd who cares what these guys are feeling?\nYou know, what do you feel?\nJess, what do you want?\nI'm the pie.\nYou're the pie. I'm the pie.\nSay it again.\nI'm the pie.\nSay it again.\nI'm the pie.\nThere you go.\nWho are you?\nNever really thought about that.\nMmm.\nI'm not gay, but I would go crazy on Michael Strahan.\nA prominent U.S. senator is trying to contact me.\nYou know, I just think Meryl Streep is a dumb bitch.\nAn important document has gone missing.\nI need to find it.\nI've been getting into a lot of fist fights lately.\nLike, a lot.\nMore than usual.\nBut, you know, I'm kind of enjoying them now.\nI have an acquaintance who's in jeopardy.\nJess?\nNope, not Jess.\nVelcro shoes, pervert.\nI didn't even see those.\nI would love for you to share... share... what you think I should do with my life.\nAm I boring you now?\nOfficer, can I read you your rights?\nYou have the right to remain hugged.\n(laughter)\nOh, no, Coach!\nAnd you have the right to remain sweet.\n(laughter)\nRun! Diversion!\nRun! Run! Now! Now! Uh, du...? Whoa. Hold on!\nWhat's with your friends, Winston Bishop?\nThey kicked over the grill, and then they ran that way.\nYeah... I know.\nWow. Last date.\nIt's a big moment.\nOh, my God, is that who I think it is?\nI give you Dreamy Eyes Jacob.\nHappy Dice birthday, Jess.\nYou're ready for this. Now, go get him.\nThank you, sir.\nJESS: Wait a minute.\nAre you from Portland?\nThe Jolly Cow Creamery.\nYeah, I used to work there summers in high school.\nNo way.

(clears throat) I get it.\nYou asked me here because -you want me to go home with you.\nWait. What?\nNo. Um, you know what? I got to go.\nI have hockey practice.\nI'm center wing, so they really need me. I... Wow.\nOkay, I just live across the street.\nI'm not some weirdo trying to lure you back to my apartment.\nI thought we were kind of hitting it off.\nGuess you just make a snap decision, and then that's it, so...\nAll right, well, have a good practice.\nAnd by the way, there's no center wing in hockey.\nThe Dice Diez!\nYou did it!\nThis thing is on!\nHow do you open it?\nOh, wow. This isn't even champagne.\nLook, it's a super fancy salad dressing.\nThat is delightful.\nWe're celebrating... Me and you. Jess, you can have whatever you want on the menu. They got pizza, gelato, Tikka Masala.\nA raw bar. This place is doing too much.\nThey can't be doing all this right. What's wrong with you?\nI just don't understand how what we did today is gonna help me find love.\nLove?\nWell, why would you want to fall in love?\nWhy else would I go on dates?\nThe point of dating is just to keep on dating, and then never stop.\nIt's like burning fossil fuels or seeing a therapist.\nNo. Schmidt, the whole point of going on dates is to fall in love and have a relationship.\nLike, don't you ever worry that you're missing out?\nI mean, you're plowing through all these girls, and some of 'em might be great, but you'll never know.\nDo you want to go through life that way?\nYeah.\nI don't.\nOh, hey, yeah. I'll take the, um... the rock shrimp meatballs.\nWhat is this place?\n(shushing)\nI think my life is going nowhere.\nOh. Mmm.\nNo, Cece. It's wonderful here.\nDo you like to learn?\nI do.\nI see you going back to school.\nI see it, too.\nYes, yes.\nI don't see it.\nYes.\nShe's a bartender.

I'm really sorry.\nUm, I was...

Great.\nHey, uh, you know, we can just make that last date disappear.\nLike... this coin.\n(laughing): Oh.\nYou're a magician.\nNo. Ugh.

Let's go in.\n(quietly): Schmidt?\nI totally didn't think I'd ever hear from you again.\nWell, you know, I just figured, why not see if there's something here?\nYou know, let's hang out, get to know each other.\nThere's a coffee place down the street.\nMaybe we could go... Grab a cup of joe.\nI don't think you understand Dice.\nOkay.\n(door closes)\nSCHMIDT: Jessica!\nI'm late to officiate a giant's wedding, and these are stuck.\n(Jacob giggles)\nNow the rings are free, but the groom is imprisoned forever.\nI know how he feels.\nYou know what they say.\nYou got to crack a few eggs to, uh... make an Amish.\nIt's an egg.\nIt's an Amish person.\nMy uncle is on fire.\nSo, you've seen a rabbit pulled out of a hat, but have you ever seen a hat pulled out of a rabbit?\nNo, no!\nOh, my...

So it's in here somewhere.\nNick, you know you're not allowed to use the French press.\nI use it to get the pulp out of my juice.\nSo just give me one second, I'll find it.\n(chuckles): Hold on.

Yeah.\nJust hear me out here.\nThe reason why men don't talk about how much they love to clean is because they're afraid to admit it.\nGive me a chance here. Be the one to put Schmidt on the map.\nLet's blast America right in the face with a little bit of Schmidt.\nOh! God in heaven! Fine!\nPut together a focus group, okay?\nI will do that.

I said yes.\nOh, yeah.\nI just said, Yes, yes, yes.\nOh, she said yes a lot.\n(laughs) She's had sex with hundreds of guys.\nYeah. You know, we spent some time trying to total them all up.\nIt was fun.\nKilled a whole Saturday. Yeah.\nWe couldn't even get through the list.\nWe got to the Ls.\n(laughs)\nBut that was in the past.\nAnd then I was diagnosed with a sex addiction.\nOh, great.\nThankfully, I attended rehab.\nWhich... did not take the first time.\nOr the second.\nMm-hmm, mm-hmm.\nBut third time's the charm.\nFor a lot of people. Not for me.\nFor me, it took four. Four times.\nWell, Bobby, we should get ready to go to the beach.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nThank you so much for this delicious brunch, Jess.\nIt was wonderful.\nI ate so much, I'm gonna have to bang nine guys just to work it off.

Because I am not sure if you heard that, but there is going to be a wedding.\nOh... there will be no wedding.\nAnd it begins.\nWhy are we meeting in a parking garage?\nBecause what we are doing is unsavory and we're hiding from God.\nAnd you also... you promised Winston and everybody pizza, so...\nYeah, you definitely did.\nYes, there'll be pizza.\nJust do one thing for me first.\nHere, memorize these.\nThat's yours. That's yours.\nI love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand.\nLook, I had to scramble, you guys.\nI told my bosses how much men love to clean.\nWhat are talking about?\nOnly you.\nYeah, only...\nYeah. I know!\nWhy do you think I'm rigging this focus group?\nSponges make me feel more exhilarated than any home run or touchdown ever could.\nThis is ridiculous, man. I'm out!\nI can buy my own pizza.\nCan somebody please loan me $15?\nMaybe like 20, 25, depending on toppings, 'cause I'd love to get a bunch of ham.\nHam. What about the tip, dude?\nWhat about tip?\nI don't give tips. It's for delivery. You don't tip delivery people, ever.\nYou definitely tip delivery people, but...\nGuys. Guys.\nI get sponges, this solves all our problems. Okay?\nI make more money, Nick gets his room back, I get my life back on track.\nPunting the Sweet Fantastic.\nFor the last time, Schmidt, that doesn't mean anything!\nFine. But I'm gonna need one hour in a quiet room to get into character.\nNo.\nRight on.\nAfter long and thoughtful and careful consideration, Winston is in.\nOkay.\nAssuming pizza is still on the table.\nSay pizza one more time, Winston.\nNo, just don't.\nJust don't.\nNo, we just never talked about when we're gonna...\nDon't.\nJust don't bring it up. He's getting really mad.\nLike, delivery of... Say pizza.\nSay pizza one more time.\nDon't say it again.\nSay pizza again.\nPizza.\nSay pizza one more time, I'm gonna k... kill you!\nI just thought maybe we'd talk about toppings, perhaps, or something.\nNot a mirror.\nNot a mirror, you idiot.\nNot a mirror.\nSponges make me feel exhilarated more than any...\nDid you just say sponges make me feel exhilarated?\n(chuckles): No, no. I... I..\nWhat do you think of sponges?\nThey're stupid.\nThat's how I feel. (laughs)\nI mean, who cares?\nEx... That's exactly how I feel.\nWhat do you think of this whole place?\nI'd rather not be here.\nBe here is what I was about to say.\n(both laughs)\n\n\nI'm Nick.\nI'm Brittany.\nOh, my God, we have so much in common.\nOkay.\nMy dad can't marry her.\nHe gets hurt in relationships with normal women.\nYeah. He can't handle a recovering sex addict.\nNo.\nWhat if she relapses?\nIt would crush him. It would crush his heart.\nI can't let this happen. I have to protect him.\nSo what are you gonna do?\nI could write him a letter about my feelings.\nWe... Yeah, but her phone is in her purse, and we could check her phone for dirt on her.\nBut he hates letters.\nHe always gets so frustrated opening the envelope.\nYou know you want to check her phone. You know you want to.\nCece, we're adults; we're gonna handle this like adults.\nWe're not snooping.\nYou're right, you're right.\nThat is... that's a huge violation of privacy; you can't do that.\nPut that... What does it say?\nIt's bad. Mm.\nGive that to me.\n(gasps)\nDad, she's cheating on you!\nWhat?\nYeah, just ask Jim.\nAt 10:40, Jim heard she was in town.\nAt 11:52, Jim had his hands down his pants.\nAnd at 11:53...\nCumin?

This was clearly a mistake.\nNo.\nAnd for the record,\nGeorge Jiang gave me giardia.\nI saved you from a hideous river disease.\nThank you.\nDamn it. She won't answer any of my calls.\nI left ten voice mails.\nTwo of them, I'm screaming. Three, I'm crying.\nOne is a long silent one. Nothing!\nAnd it's all your fault... both of you guys.\nBut mostly you.\nLook, Dad, I'm so sorry.\nIs there anything I can do...\nThere's nothing more that you can do.\nI... I knew this was a mistake bringing her here.\nWait, Dad.\n(door slams)\nSCHMIDT: So, uh, why don't you tell me what you think about that sponge there, Coach.\nI mean... (clears throat) Ernie.\nI don't know why I would call you Coach.\nOkay. Um... (clears throat)\nWell, I love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand.\nWow, thank you so much for that.\nI wish my buddies could see me now.\nWhat?\nThey'd be all like, Hey, man, let me get a hit of that squishy whip.\nRight on.

Melnir. Mjolnir.\nOkay, wonderful detail. Thank you so much for that.\nUh, how about you down there, Mayor of the Corner?\n(chuckles)\n(pounds table) Nick.\nWhat?\nHow does cleaning make you feel?\nUh, like I-I'm cleaning. Move on to somebody else, please.\n(quietly): Read the cards that I gave you. Remember the cards?\nNot now.\n(pounds table) Read your cards!\nYou want to know what I think about your sponges?!\n(imitates farting)\n(laughs)\n(laughs)\nWell, this is clearly rigged.\nMy office. Now, Schmidt.\nSchmidt...\nSchmidt, I'm sorry.\n(door closes)\nDad.\nThanks for waiting.\nI wasn't waiting. I just can't get this damn thing started.\nYou're just pressing buttons.\nThis was supposed to be a big weekend for me and Ashley.\nI had everything planned.\nI... I even wrote new lyrics to our... our song.\n(high-pitched):  Ashley, marry me... \n(engine starts)\nY... you didn't have to do that, you know.\nI can take care of myself.\nCan you? Dad, if I hadn't protected you after you and Mom's divorce, you would've ended up with Nancy Zimmerman.\nOh, Nancy Zimmerman.\nShe was bad news, Dad.\nOoh, v... very bad. You don't know the half of it.\nThat woman made me try cocaine in 2005.\nWhat, Dad?! Booger sugar?\nYes.\nNicaraguan yazz.\nAre you kidding me?\nIt was a very expensive evening.\nI wound up buying his and her Jet Skis.\nThe point is I'm still standing, and I can take care of myself.\nYes, I might get hurt, but that'll be my problem.\nYou don't need to do it anymore, Jess.\nI should be taking care of you.\nAshley is different from any woman I've ever dated.\nShe... she makes every day better.\nI... I want to spend the rest of my life with her.\nAw, Dad, that's so sweet.\n(car alarm chirps)\nHey!\nHey, Th... Ashley!\nJESS: What did she do? She went out and found a guy?\nShe's gonna relapse. Um...\nOh, we have to turn her off. Ashley...\nLet's turn on NPR and blare it.\nOh...\nAshley, wait. Wait a minute. Please. Please don't do this. Please.\nJESS: Ashley, if you're gonna relapse, relapse with my dad.\nI'm not relapsing.\nThis is Roy. He's my L.A. sponsor.\nBOB: This is Roy? Oh!\nYou know, I... I always wanted to meet you. Hi.\nJess, he's not a strange man.\nHe's a sex addict.\nFormer sex addict. Uh, current chocoholic.\nI'd be in trouble if you were black.\nThank you?\nAshley, look, I screwed up.\nI have to let my dad make mistakes.\nOh, I'm a mistake?\nNo, you are not a mistake.\nThat came out wrong.\nI'm sorry, Bob.\nI never meant to come between you and your daughter.\nI love you so damn much.\nYou're my big, round, bald, fuzzy Weeble-Wobble.\nBut I just... I just need a little space.\nIt's not over, Dad.\nGet the ring.\nI'm sorry, Schmidt. What can I say?\nYou're just not really built to play with the big girls.\nDon't fire him!\nOh, God.\nWhat the... Why?\nGive him the account.\nHe's a hard worker, and he's a neat freak.\nHow do I know that? 'Cause I share a room with him.\nYou two share a room?\nAnd you should see his side.\nIt is so clean. It looks like the inside of a Japanese subway.\nSpeaking of sharing a bedroom, Brittany's coming over tonight.\nUh, so I'm gonna need ten to 15 minutes of privacy for...\nI don't need 15 minutes. That's excessive.\nGive me five to ten.\nThat feels braggy. Give me three to five, but no less than three 'cause that's rude to girls.\nDo you really think that she's gonna have sex with you in that pulp-covered filth bunker? - I'll throw a tarp down.\nOh, God.\nSCHMIDT: What if she's turned off by the mess? What if she's turned off by...\nWhat if she's turned off by the mess?\nHey, Gina, why don't you hear me out here for a second.\nThat's all right.\nIf Nick cleans his room before Brittany comes over, he might get laid.\nI don't know. It seems like a lot of work.\nNot with the right tool.\nWe open up on a modern man with a nose that only America could love.\nThis might seem obvious, but what side does the dirty stuff go on?\nHe doesn't know a lot, but he's about to discover the ultimate wingman.\nNICK: I bet this side is really good for tough areas.\nThe Man Sponge.\nBecause the dirtiest thing in your room...\nProbably be her. (chuckles)\nYay. We're doing a pitch.\nYeah. (chuckles)\nI... can't believe I'm saying this, but I like it.\nAll right, you get the sponge account, Schmidt.\nSponges. We got sponges.\nWe got sponges.

Come on.\nAshley... will you marry me?\nAnd be the stepmom to a very crazy but... but very lovable woman?\n(chuckles): Yes.\nYes. Yes!\nOh, yes!\nJess, you're my little girl now.\nOh, Jess.\nYou go to your room. (laughs): I'm just kidding.\nI'm kidding. But you should go to a-a hospital.\nHere's to attending a wedding with everyone from high school and my dad's side of the family.\nIt's gonna be great. It's like going to prom with all my dad's friends.\nNICK: Hear, hear!\n(cheering)\nOh. Oh.\nNo, no, no, no.\nDon't worry, don't worry.\nI got it. I got it. I'll just clean it.\nCOACH: Dude, there's a sponge in your hand.\nSCHMIDT: No, let him go.\nHe's my inspiration. You know, living with him in that slovenly hellhole has been a secret blessing.\nIt's made me stronger.\nWithout ash to rise from, the phoenix would just be a bird getting up.\nI am a phoenix, and I will rise.\nHe usually says that speech before sex.\nBy 2015, I will have my own room. And by 2016...\nCOACH: What is he looking at?\nI don't know.\n... I will be a millionaire.\n(all groaning)\n(piano playing gentle music)\n(gasps)\nSpongey make wipey.\nANNOUNCER: The Man Sponge.\nBecause the dirtiest thing in your room... \nShould be me.\nSponge.

Now, see, my boobs got to go \"ooh!\"\n(All chuckling) Yeah.\nOh, my God.\nYou guys are ruling women out based on their breast size?\nIt's the least important part of a woman's body.\nUnless you're a baby. Are you guys babies?\nWe're not babies.\nI'd like to think that... that you guys see value in women's bodies other than just the way they look.\nCome on, Jess, you're really gonna tell me that you don't care what a guy looks like?\nWell... I'll notice an attractive man.\nI can go to the butcher and pick out a nice rump.\nBut I'm not gonna rule out a guy based on how he looks... that's shallow.\nThat's crazy.\nYeah, right. That explains...\nSo much.\nWhat?\nOkay, if you saw me in the bar and I was a stranger, would you rule me out based on my breast size?\nAbsolutely not. Your breasts are perfect.\nNow, if I saw your wonky knee? (Chuckles)\nThat's a whole 'nother ballgame.\nWhat w... Wonky knee?\nYou have a wonky knee?\nYou think I have a wonky knee?\nThe left knee's perfect.\nUh, but the right one's got some stuff.\nWhy?\nWell, stuff.\nUm... oh, why do you think I always let you take your own pants off before sex?\nBecause you're the laziest person I've ever met.\nWonky knee, huh?

But, like climate change, we pretend they don't exist.\n(Snickering, laughing)\nRight?\nDo you guys all just think you're so perfect?\nYeah. Pretty close.\nAh, please.\nI mean, you're an eight, you're an eight and a half.\nEverybody knows I'm a sweet, sweet six.\nWinston, for the last time.

But, you know, while-while we're on the subject of stupid physical stuff, you know, I should probably tell you before we go out, uh...\nMm-hmm?\nI have a micropenis.\nCool. What?\nIt's a medical condition... it means I'm unusually small.\nTechnically, \"micro.\"\nWell... Lucky for you... My eyes are bigger than my stomach.\nI don't know... what that means. but I'm free tomorrow night.\nS04E04\nMicro\nCoach: It's an actual medical condition.\nHere's a web page all about it.\nI don't know what I'm looking at.\nWhere is the...\nIt's right there.

You barely know him.\nMan made it through middle school with that ghoulish raisin. He's a hero.\nI bet you're not gonna last a week with this guy.\nI bet I last at least a month.\nYou want to put money down?\nOh, absolutely.\n500 bucks.\nAll right.\nWinston: Wow.\nGreat.\nWow.\nYou said yeah?\nIf I date him a month, then you will donate 500 bucks to the national organization for women's love your body campaign.\nAnd if you win, I will get you a subscription to the p0rn site of your choosing.\nReally?\nYeah.\n(Speaking quietly)\nWinston: Nubile Nubian Butts.\nWe know, dude.\nShut up, Winston.\nWe're gonna go with ass chat.\nAss chat? Come on, what is that... two butts talking to each other?\nIt's not butts talking to each other.\nNo, it's all a lot categories.\nI'd like you to realize, someday, that a nice, sweet guy who just happens to have a lil' squeaker is just as attractive as a guy with a blue-ribbon hog that's ready for market.\nHoney, if you have a blue-ribbon hog, you don't take it to the market, you breed that pig.\n(Laughs)\n'Cause what's he gonna do at the market?\nJess: Shut up, Nick.\nYou know what I mean?\nWinston, honestly...\nI'm sure the national organization of women will look forward to your donation.\nHey, boys, why don't you push heavy up?\nGet 'em, heavy.\nWe got us a bet.\nSo now I was like screw it grandma.\nI'm-a become a street artist, yo.\nI mean, most people see a wall and they just see a wall.\nI look at a wall and I see, like... a goat in a backpack.\nRight.\nLike, a ninja handing out cheeseburgers.\nWhoa.\nA chill alien, you know?\nWell, who doesn't see a chill alien?\nThat's my question.\nLot of people.\nLot of people. It's sad.\nYou have any tattoos?\nNo.\nI got seven.\nOh, good.\nCheck it.\nOkay.\nCustom font.\nI invented that font.\nMm-hmm.\nStar.\nI have a question... do you know of a web site called \"ass chat\"\nand do you know if it's socially conscious?\nJust based off the name, I'd say, probably, yeah.\nHey! Okay, so you guys are kind of bringing the bar vibe down, and I need tips, so...\nPretend that you're having fun or pay for me to go to college.\nYou know, if I could give that poor man some of my penis, I would.\nBut, obviously, you don't pull a bumper off a Ferrari.\nIt did go fast, I'll give it that.\nYou know, when I look at that picture, I think to myself, \"is there a God? And if-if there is, did he run out of Clay?\"\nWinston: I just put five dollars in the jukebox.\nWe got a Paula Cole rock block coming our way.\nI'm just so thankful, you know?\nHere we are, beautiful as all heck.\nNormal to above-normal endowments.\nThat's right.\nIt's like why were we given so much while others were given so little?\nI don't understand.\nYou know, I look at you and I see a stunning physical specimen.\nIt's like you were created in a la... in a lab. full of gay scientists.\nCoach: You have a perfect body, my friend.\nYou're like the only Jewish Greek God... (Throaty \"h\"): Hercules.\nThanks, buddy.\nYou're cute as a button, bro.\nAppreciate that.\nYou're swoll, my friend.\nNo, look, I work at it.\nYou're super swoll.\nNo, it's something I work at.\nNo, I mean that, though.\nIt doesn't happen overnight.\nIt's something that I put the work in, just like you do.\nYou look good, dude.\nSchmidt: We're blessed, the two of us.\nCoach: Beyond blessed. Just... I feel like we should be doing more to share our beauty with the world.\nRight? It's frustrating.\nIt's fru... It's frustrating.\nSo frustrating.\nLet me ask you something, guys, haveou er considered modeling?\nNow, that would be a great way to share your beauty with the world.\nThat's crazy.\nWhat? Winston, we're grown men with real jobs.\nModeling is a real job and, trust me, neither one of you could do it.\nSchmidt: What? Give me a break, CeCe.\nI could model in my sleep.\nModeling is exactly what these two should be doing.\nI bet they would take some amazing pictures.\nA drunk baby with a phone in its mouth couldn't take a bad picture of you two.\nOh, well... I mean...\nI mean, I mean.\nNick.\nYeah.\nNick, um, uh, I need out of the bet.\nYeah. No, seriously, 'cause, um, he's coming out of the bathroom soon, and, um, he's actually... He's the worst.\nSo the date's not going well.\nI know what you're thinking. It's not 'cause of the thing.\nFirst of all, he's a street artist; Second of all... he called a scotch on the rocks a sko ro.\nOoh, that hurts.\nI can't date him for a month... like, I can't even spend like, five minutes with him.\nRight. I get it.\nSo you have to let me out of the bet, please.\nYou're saying a lot of words, but all I'm hearing is, \"he's too small.\"\nNo. It's not because of that. He has a... He has a tattoo that just says \"Warrior Poet.\"\nSounds to me like you're being pretty shallow, Jess.\nNo. He tipped the waiter with a sketch of a hip-hop mouse.\nHe did? That's incredible.\nYes!\nWhat's up, man?\nDo you mind what's up, my man?\nIf I graffiti your bathroom?\nI want to paint a skylight on the floor that looks into hell.\nOh... no, that's okay.\nI'd prefer if you didn't.\nMatt: Are you sure? Okay.\nI'm positive. Yeah.\nHe's wearing skinny jeans.\nThey fit him like sweatpants.\nThinking of asking this lovely lady on a second date?\nNo diggity, no doubt. (Whoops)\nWe can go speaker shopping, drink some sko ros, if that's where the rhythm takes us...\nMm.\nUm, unfortunately, I will be out of town for the next month.\nOh, for trues?\nYeah, for trues.\nHello. This drink is for you, from those gentlemen over there.\nYou the man.\nSkol!\nDo you know those bros?\nNope.\nAnyway, I'm gonna be out of town for a month, but, uh, we can go out on another date, perhaps when I'm back.\nTechnically, our, um, one-month anniversary.\nJess, you're not going away for a month.\nShe keeps forgetting that that got canceled. You're available.\nNo, but you keep forgetting it was rescheduled.\nYou weren't on the e-mail.\nOkay. That doesn't sound for trues.\nFor true.\nYou're not really going out of town, are you?\nOh, gosh. Uh, Matt... (Sighs)\nIf I'm being honest, I don't think we should go on a second date.\nI get it.\nYeah.\nIt's because of my micropenis.\nNo!\nI looked it up and I-I actually feel like I could make that work. Um...\nNo, it's...\nDon't take this the wrong way, but...\nIt's actually your personality and everything about you.\nYou think I'm a douche bag.\nYou said that you thought street art was the closest thing to an education homeless people would ever get.\nOkay.\nAnd I when I asked you, \"is that a joke?\" You said...\nYour mom is a joke.\nYeah. You said, \"your mom is a joke.\"\nRight? That's kind of a douchey response.\nI'm really sorry.\nI mean, I've been made fun of my entire life... in school, in locker rooms... so, yeah, I can be a douche bag sometimes.\nBut I'm this way... because of my micropenis.\nLater.\nRadiant. You don't even need Yes, yes. this bounce board. You're making your own light, man.\nNo doubt, no doubt.\nWinston, you getting this?\nOh, hell, yeah, dude. I'm getting all of this.\nFlawless.\nYeah, there you go. All right.\nNow give me some stuff like it's the first day of school, right?\nOkay.\nThat's right, and you got your backpack on. Yeah, there you go.\nBut you packed your own lunch. But what you don't know is when you were making it, you got some mustard on your forehead.\nThat's right.\nNow you're playing pictionary, okay?\nNow you're playing pictionary, and what do you...\nOoh, now I got... Now I got my little card.\nWhat am I gonna draw? What am I gonna draw?\nYou get sardines.\nThey don't smell good.\nHow do I draw a smell? How do I draw a smell? \nWhat does that look like?\nThat's modeling. That's right.\nWow, this is great.\nHey, give me five. I got to protein-load.\nSchmidt: What do you see we split that last packet of power goo.\nI cannot believe that this actually worked.\nOh, man...\nNo, that's a lie...\nI would've been surprised if it didn't.\nA classic CeCe-Winston mess around.\nThat's not a thing.\nAll right.\nSo, guys, I was looking at the shots here, and they're really incredible.\nI think I could call my modeling agent, if you want.\nI know this... we're-we're, like, just doing this for fun and everything, but part of me wants that to happen more than anything else in the whole wide world.\nUgh! No, but my agent probably would only want one of you, and you guys are a team, so I shouldn't call.\nHold on. (Chuckles) You don't want to be rude to the man.\nNo, no, no, no, no. We don't want to see you guys pitted against each other.\nMm-mm.\nP-pitted against each other?\nPit...? What are you talking about?\nI think, you know...\nI'm more runway.\nHe's more...\nYeah, I feel like I'm more catalog, high fashion.\nCatalog, back of the mag.\nYou're t... you're too big for high fashion.\nAlso, my agent really loves piggyback shots, so...\nWe should piggyback.\nWe'll piggyback right now.\nOh.\nYeah.\nLet me get on, man.\nYou get on me.\nI didn't know you guys had it in you.\nI want to be on the bottom.\nLet me be on the bottom.\nYeah, yeah, you're a little piggy.\nBottom's my game, dude.\nNo, me...\nYou went to the market. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nLittle piggy went to the market. (Laughs)\nJust let me... (Groans)\nDamn it. No.\nOh, yeah.\nIt's like shooting candy into a baby.\nMm...\nThat's it. That's it.\nYeah, give me that. Give me that!\nI could... I could...\nI can totally dig this.\n\n\n\nHey, Jess.\nHey.\nI know you're bummed and so I hate to do this, but I want to look at p0rn and you owe me a year's worth.\nYeah, okay. You know what?\nYou earned this p0rn.\nAnd the vip pass.\nAnd the \"Kitty Room live cam experience.\"\nDo you really need all of this?\nJust click the boxes.\nMatt was right. I am shallow.\nIt's like I jumped to a conclusion about him, but I didn't have the whole story.\nI thought I was better than you guys. Mm...\nBut I'm a superficial size queen.\nCoach: Hey, guys?\nCan you tell schmidt that my portfolio is way better than his portfolio?\nLook at that: I'm better wet, I'm better dry, my sexy baby is way more believable than his.\nWatch, look... mama change baby 'cause baby made a dirty...\nSchmidt: Okay, mine is way more sexy.\nThere are people lining up in the streets to have sex with my baby.\nLiar!\nI don't like this.\nYou can't use that photo, unless you're planning on posing for the tiny nipples of America foundation.\nSchmidt: Yeah, you're one to talk, little miss princess waist!\nHey, I'm a 26! That's normal!\nYeah, in Asia.\nWho's talking to you, depression-era garbage man?\nI've been holding that in for two years.\nI said one thing.\nGuys, stop attacking each other!\nCome on. He's making fun of you\n'cause he feels sensitive about his geisha waist.\nAnd you're putting him down\n'cause you've got those cute little kitten teats.\nEverybody has something.\nShe's right, you know. She's right.\nLook, I grew up fat, and I have scars that you can't see.\nAnd I'm not talking about the stretch marks that I had removed by laser beams.\nMm.\nNo matter how many miles I run, I'll never outrun that feeling.\nDamn, son.\nI didn't even know it was like that.\nIt'll always be like that, my man.\nStill better than having a micro penis.\nSo much better.\nYeah.\nIt's true.\nGuys!\nWe're all covered in micro penises.\nNo, I'm not.\nCoach: Come again?\nNo, thank you.\nI don't want to be covered in anything.\nNo, it's not true.\nYes! Yes! No! We all have flaws!\nWe're all freaks!\nAll of us.\nWe have to support each other!\nI knew it!\nI am better than you guys.\nThank you for helping me realize that.\nI know now why I was superficial.\nIt's because I was scared.\nOf my micro...\nNo. No!\nOf mine.\nWhat?!\nI'm saying that we should all celebrate our flaws! Together!\nI'm saying that...\nThe one day I wear jeans.\n(Groans)\nI'm saying, look. We're exactly the same.\nI'm sorry, what-what am I looking at?\nThis monstrosity the doctors call a knee that I didn't know was a problem till, like, three days ago.\nWhat the hell is this?!\nYou have a girlfriend?\nHe did!\nWhoa, whoa... How can... no, no, no!\nMatt: How dare you!\nThat's war question mark!\nHow dare you don't answer me!\nThink I should go.\nYou owe me $12,000! (Door slams)\nWait, wait... Jess, I can explain.\nOkay, why are you not running after your girlfriend right now?\nAah, if I'm being totally honest, she was getting a little fat.\nNo, she was... that's crazy!\nI wouldn't behave like this if someone, just once...\n(Voice breaking): Just once, took the time to get to know...\nYou're not even crying!\nYou are unbelievable!\nIs anything about you real? Anything? Do you even have a micro penis, or is that...?\nIt... it... looks like a... little tiny... pigeon's egg.\nDon't you want to hatch the bird?\nNo, I definitely, definitely do not.\nYou're... you're a very complicated person.\nUm...\nBut I'm glad I met you.\nSort of.\nI mean, I don't know why, but... I kind of am.\nAnyway, take care of that little rug-rat.\nHe needs you.\nHey, man.\nOh, hey. I'm just, uh...\nIt's all right.\nI'm just, I'm just looking over some of the pics from today.\nI don't know which one to send to the agent.\nI've narrowed it down to 60.\nI can take a look at 'em.\nYeah, okay.\nJust tell me what you think about a couple of these.\nI just, I don't know what's what at this point.\nThis \"hot guy with a kidnapped son...\"\nWow.\nHe really looks like he's never gonna find his son.\n\"Classical guitarist loses a shoe.\"\nThat guy's never gonna find his shoe.\nI don't know.\nThis is \"cuddles with tigers.\"\nOh-ho.\nIt's good.\nThis is \"how did I get up here?\"\nWhat do you think about this one?\n\"Kiss the cook.\"\nSee, I like \"kiss the cook.\"\nIt's catalogue.\nHis lips are popping.\nThere's an accessibility with this one that I feel like...\nSchmidt, relax. I'm bowing out.\nI want you to have this.\nCome on. What?!\nWhy are you doing that, coach?\nBecause you obviously need this more than I do.\nWhen you look in the mirror, you see a fat kid.\nI don't. I don't know how that feels.\nI do.

Then I touched my peen.\n(Scatting cheerily)\nThere he is.\nAll right, Nick, hey, uh, you were home today.\nDid anybody leave any messages about my interview for tomorrow?\nI don't know.

I don't even know how to pronounce that.\nIt's Paul.\nI'll take that Paul, I'll take him to a water park, I will.\nI'll put him on one of those waterslides between two obese people and he'll get smushed to death.\nDie in a... Die in a water... He'll die between the obese people before he drowns in the water.\nWhat?\nHmm?\nSchmidt, that is exactly the kind of talk we can't have today when the LAPD comes here.\nUm... the, uh, cops are coming here?\nYes.\nLike, here, here?\nYes.\nLike, to our home, w-where we keep our stuff?\nWhy can't we just go there? We'll just go there, a-answer some questions, get an ice coffee on the way back... I really feel like ice coffee.\nIt's a home visit, Jess.\nAnd not just from any cop. It's from Sergeant Tess Dorado. The Fish.\nI'm pretty sure they call her The Fish because she's tough but fair, just like most fish I've interacted with.\nWinston, \"Dorado\" is a fish.\nIt's a subset of mahi-mahi and it pairs very nicely with citrus, you oaf.\nI'm not a oaf, you're a oaf, stupid.\nSo... You're dumb. Shut up.\nAlso, put on some underpants, please. It's like a bounce house down there.\nDo you guys think that the cops are gonna go through our stuff?\nWhat are you afraid of? They'll look through your dream journal?\nNo, I just...\nWhat, are you running a sweatshop back there for skirts that look like curtains?\nActually...\nWhat'd you- What'd you, steal a kiss and hide it in an envelope?\n(all laugh)\nI have a bag of meth in my closet.\nOh, I know it's in here somewhere...\nOh, oh, ooh. These are my \"bad decision\" hats.\nBad decision, right?\nHow do you not know where a bag of meth is?\nFind it and get rid of it.\nFind it, get rid of it.\nJess, why do you have meth in your closet?\nDo you remember that day when I was trying to convince you guys to come with me to that waffle restaurant in the Antelope Valley that I found?\nAnd you were like, \"That's way too far to go for waffles.\"\nTurns out you were right... How good can a waffle really be?\nThat's the question I answered that...\nTell us the story faster.\nYour waffle story sucks.\nWhere is the bag of crystal methamphetamine, you dummy?\nOkay, fine. Do you see that footstool?\nI bought it at a garage sale.\nTurns out the top opens up and when I opened up the top, I found... here it is... this.\nCoach: Holy frickin' what?\n(whoops)\nAah!\nOh, hey. How do I look?\nTerrible.\nN- Not for me.\nNot great.\nLike crap.\nGo change.\nI don't like any of it.\nWow. You guys are like rubbing alcohol.\nYou sting me in the now, but save me in the later.\nAll right.\nOkay, Winston cannot find out about this.\nBecause if he doesn't know, he can't get in trouble, and he's probably already failing out of the academy as it is.\nAlso, why are you keeping this in your closet?\nWhat am I supposed to do, notify the authorities? I'm sorry, Officer, I found this bag of meth in a footstool I bought at a garage sale. Uh, no.\nMy closet is safe. The only person who goes in there is me when I'm naked and/or sad.\nHey. Much better, right?\nI found it on the lawn.\n(chuckles)\nAnd that's the whole story.\nSo, you guys ready? She's on her way.\nWhy don't you go wait for her downstairs?\nDon't make her buzz up like a shawarma boy.\nGood idea, good idea.\nThis way, I get to tell her my sidewalk joke.\nYou remember the sidewalk joke, right?\nThere's a man on the s...\nHow's it...? There's a man on the...\nOh, you know, okay...\nEverybody just calm down.\nEspecially you, Nick, you're already sopping wet.\nLying makes me sweat. I can't lie.\nIt's why I don't play poker or talk to pregnant ladies.\nNo one has to lie. I'm just going to get rid of it.\n(mutters anxiously)\nI'm gonna call Cece.\nShe knows about this stuff.\nShe lived one summer in Milan with a guy named Crystal Randy.\nAsk her about the date.\nHey, Cece, quick question. How does one get rid of a bag of meth? Call me back.\nAsk her if Paul is taller than me.\nStop it.\nDid she surrender her virtue?\nHey.\nThrow it in the trash.\nI can't see it.\nI can't see where it goes, 'cause then when she comes in here, I'll just yell \"trash!\" I'll yell \"trash!\"\nCover your ears and sing \"Landslide.\"\nSchmidt: Let's call Cece again.\n# Took my love and I took it down d... #\nWe need to get this back in my closet...\nI could see your lips moving.\nWell, close your eyes.\n(Nick singing)\nThrow it out the window, okay?\nI'll sneak down there, I'll toss it in the Dumpster. Here.\nOh!\nJess: Oh, my God!\nWhat the heck, Jess?\nJess: I threw like a boy!\nI've always thrown like a boy!\nYou almost hit me in the face!\nWhat are you, nuts?\nOverhand?\nOh, well, Winston's a goner.\nYou know, this building used to be a biscuit factory.\nAnd apparently, the mice have not been told it's gone residential.\nWas that a joke?\nI hate jokes.\n# ...of changing #\nJess: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.\n# 'Cause I built We just have to hide this. #\n# My whole life around you Throw it in here. #\nCome on!\nI was bringing it to you!\nWhy does everybody keep asking me to throw stuff?\nSchmidt: Work on your aim!\nThis is actually a really good song.\nNick, stop singing!\nWhere are we gonna put this?\nPut it in the baggie!\nFun Saturday?\nNo. My bird died.\nWell, my mom used to say when a bird dies, he gets another set of wings in heaven, so...\nWell, that bird was going straight to hell.\nWelcome to our home.\nI will ask you questions. You will ask me no questions.\nIn pursuit of that, I will offer up three personal facts: I was born in St. Louis, I have three brothers, two of whom were killed in separate plane crashes, and...\nI like music.\nGood? Good.\nNow, let's get started...\nMy name is Nick.\nNicholas Miller?\nI- I don't... I don't know.\nSchmidt: Hah!\nHe's just messing around with you.\nHe's our resident clown here.\nDorado: Let's keep this simple.\nI need to be home in time to feed my bird.\nOh, God.\n(light clattering)\nUh, green grape? Would you like...?\nNo, thanks.\nI already had my grapes.\nJess!\nI got your message.\nWhere's the freaking me...\nPlay along, or Jess goes to jail.\nWhat are you doing?\nHey.\nLook, it's my girlfriend Cece.\nWhat's up, Cece?\nAh, it's his girlfriend Cece.\nWinston: Girlfriend? Oh, my goodness, you guys are back together?\nYeah.\nNo, uh...\nLike I always say, you can't put peanut butter and jelly on the same shelf and expect 'em not to mix.\n'Cause somebody got to eat a sandwich.\nIt's exciting.\nYeah, no.\nMoving on. Miss Day, in your own words, please state why Cadet Bishop would be an asset to the Los Angeles Police Department.\nA few kind words. Known me for a long time.\nYeah.\nIt's your boy Winnie the Bish.\nOh!\n(light clattering)\nI have to go to the bathroom.\nWinston: If you guys will excuse me for just one second.\nOkay.\nWill somebody answer the question so I can write it on the form and we can get on with our lives?\nWhy would Bishop make a good police officer?\nMustache.\nI'm sorry?\nBecause, uh, Winston has a mustache.\nAnd, uh, police officers all have mustaches.\nNo, they don't. Not the ladies.\nUnless the ladies want to.\nWhy can't a lady have a mustache?\nShe can. And it would look sexy.\nWould you like a green grape shoved in your... given to your mouth? Handed to your mouth?\nI'm asking a simple question, unless you don't think he would be an asset to the LAPD.\nNo, he- he would. He definitely would.\nYeah, he would.\nYou know, Winston has done plenty for, uh, the, um... community.\nHe has a little brother at the Boys & Girls Club.\nOf course. All the work that Winston does with the Boys & Girls Club that he actually does in real life.\nSo much work at the Boys & Girls Club.\nYeah. So passionate.\nWhat was his little brother's name again?\nDuke.\nJuan.\nDuquan is his name.\nDuquan.\nDuquan. Duquan.\nAnd I'm Nick Miller.\nHey, let me ask you s... um...\nHmm?\nBreasts.\nIt's my cycle.\nAlready?\nDamn, girl. My calendar is way off on you.\nYou must be, what, like, ten days early?\nAw, Winston. Someday you're gonna make some lucky girl really uncomfortable. Can you go get Cece and tell her to meet me in the bathroom?\nSure. And, girl, uh, you ain't got a cycle... you got a roller coaster.\n(chuckles) Don't I know it, girl?\nMm-hmm.\n(growls, chuckles)\nDuquan Feldman?\nI'm gonna make a note to call the Boys & Girls Club.\nNo!\nWhy not?\nUh, because he's coming here.\nWhy would... why would Duquan come- come here?\nBecause he comes here every Saturday.\nHe does?\nThen where is he?\nHuh?\nIt's Saturday. Where is he?\nHe's at the bus station. He's waiting for, uh, one of us to get him, and, uh...\nYou know what? I'll go do it. You guys stay put.\nYou're gonna go and get Duquan?\nI think so.\nYeah.\nYou guys, anybody want to... come... with? No?\n(sighs) Where are you, Duquan?\nHey. Cece, Jess needs some help with some lady stuff.\nOf course.\nYou know how we do.\n(chuckles)\nSchmidt: Whoof...\nGonna...\nMust be a rough one.\nYou know what, I'm gonna have a look around.\nWhat a great i... You know what, you should start with Nick and I's room. We share it.\nHey, don't mind the condoms. We've been banging like rabbits.\nNot each other.\nWhat are you doing? Jessica.\nNo, Jessica! What are you doing? You do not put drugs down the shower drain. Have you never seen a drug movie before?\nI don't know. I saw <i>Ray.</i>\nThat does not count.\nI might have ruined Winston's chances of being a cop.\nWell, we can cry about that later. We are gonna take the drugs now and we're gonna go flush 'em, all right?\nWhat are you doing? Come on. Help me. Pick up the drugs, Jess.\nI think that the meth entered my bloodstream through my boob skin.\nThat is not a thing.\nThat's not how drugs work.\nI'm the one on meth! Don't tell me how drugs work!\nOkay.\n(toilet gurgling)\nOh, my God.\n(exhaling anxiously)\nCould you open this trunk?\nOh, I'll do more than open it.\nI don't know why I said that.\nI'm gonna open the trunk.\n(whispers): I think I'm having a heart attack.\nWhat are you... Oh, my God.\nYou're a mess. Here. Cover up. Cover...\nNo, I'm not putting that... I'm not putting on your kimono. It legitimizes you owning it.\nJust put it on. Put it on.\nOkay.\nI'm wearing a kimono.\nI see that. Why?\nWhy? Why is he still wearing pants? That's the real question.\n(creaking, clanging)\nWhat's all that going on out there?\nI'm on drugs. I'm on drugs...\nWhat's all that clanging?\nUh, just a bunch of clanging.\nWell, there's feminine issues...\nIt's probably the ladies playing with their jewelry.\nTheir brooches.\nYou know how... Brooches. Of course.\nNick makes a very good point.\nI'm gonna go check on that right now, actually.\nUh, Winston, why don't you show the good sergeant Jess' room?\nWhat?\nWhat a great idea.\nOh, I've had intercourse in there.\nYou'll be excited to...\nI think I'm gonna take off, too.\nNick, what is going on out there?\nWhat's going on out there?\nNo, I'm asking you what's going on.\nHmm?\nWhat's going on?\n\n\n\n(grunting quietly)\nIt's gonna be okay.\nHey, what happened to the \"turlet\"?\nSchmidt, you're here. So we're in a little bit of a thing right now, but you're our best cleaner.\nWe might be out of towels, but you'll figure out something.\nRight? It's gonna be fun.\nJess, are you crying right now?\nI don't know.\nI hadn't noticed. Um... (sniffles)\nI might be on drugs.\nYou gonna help mop or are you just gonna try to kiss me again?\nOh, please.\nYou kissed me back. Your... I felt your lips surrender. And who's this Paul anyway? Paul.\nWhat, does he work in a pizzeria?\nYes, Schmidt, I went on a date with a guy named Paul.\nYou just need to get over it.\nPaul. Paul. Nice name, dude.\nWhy is your shirt off?\nI've seen <i>New Jack City</i>, okay?\nThey all take their shirts off in the crack cocaine lab!\nAh, it won't go down!\nHats off to the hillbilly that made this meth.\nMeth?\nWhat meth?\nThis meth.\nIt's... legal meth.\nIt's... medical meth.\nFor my... cramps.\nWait a minute. Who's with Nick? d I took my love and I took it down d d I drove around and I hit a pound d d And I saw all the puppies with their d d Eyes so blind...\nNick! Nick!\nSergeant Dorado, don't listen to him! He's deranged!\nI'm gonna talk to this man alone.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\nThat is not good.\nNo.\nSo, this Paul...\nI've never seen someone sweat so much in my life. It looks like your body is crying.\nWhat are you hiding?\nDistraction!\nOkay. You're a tough cookie.\nAnd that's the last thing I'll say.\nLook...\nOkay, you want the truth? I'll tell you everything.\nWhen I was 13 years old, I once made love to myself behind a post office.\nOh.\nHey!\n(honks horn)\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!\nYo! What's up? You in the shorts.\nHey, come here, man. Come here. I need a little boy.\n(chuckles) Whoa. No. That's not what I meant. No, no, no.\nI didn't mean... You know what I'm... Ah.\nI wasn't trying to...\nIt's for my friend, you know?\nI need you to come over to, uh, hang out with my friends.\nNo, not like that. I just need you to pretend like, uh, you're in a relationship with this grown man that I know. Ah! Ah! Uh, I did not think this through. Did not think this through.\nUm, bad decision. Very bad decision.\nI'm gonna go now. Don't remember my face.\nForget this face. This didn't happen.\nWhat is wrong with the name Paul, okay?\nPaul is a normal name. He is a normal guy.\nThat <i>is</i> the problem, okay?\nYou shouldn't be with a normal guy.\nAll right, okay.\nIt was Mark-Paul Gosselaar.\nWhat? You... you were... you were with Zack Morris?\nMm-hmm.\nGuy's a frigging god.\nI mean, all right. I've... I surrender.\nThat's awes... Can I come to the wedding?\n(laughs) You think Slater and Screech are gonna be there?\n(laughing): I'm kidding. I just wanted to freak you out.\nYou really had me going there for a second.\n(laughing) It works every time with you.\nIt's amazing. Now...\nThere was a real second there where I had bad feelings towards Mark-Paul Gosselaar, and I didn't like any moment of that.\nHow dare you. Don't ever do that to me again.\nWhen I was nine years old, I fed cereal flakes to a frog, and it died.\nThen I went into a period of time where I fed cereal flakes to all little animals.\nSquirrels can live through it, chipmunks can live through it.\nAnything that lives half in and out of water dies, and I don't understand why.\nWhen I was ten, I once walked by my mother sleeping, and I snuck in the room, and I put a lemon in her mouth.\nWhen I was 11, I once tried on my girl cousin's wool tights, and I didn't hate the way it felt!\nWhy are you telling me this?\nBecause you said you wanted to hear everything!\nMy sixteenth year, I never got an erection.\nI thought they were done.\nI thought my penis was dead.\nIt wasn't.\nIt's fine, Winston. We can fix this.\nJust help me mule this crank.\nI'll prepare, you mule.\nI can't mule crank. I don't have the system.\nIt's the perfect plan. I don't think it is.\nJess, do you know how much time we could get for possessing this much meth? Why'd you hide it from me?\nI was trying to protect you.\nI should've been the first person you told!\nI could've taken care of it, or something.\nNow it just looks like we're hiding it.\nI just...\nI didn't... I didn't think there was anything you could do.\nAnd- and why is that?\nBecause... I don't know!\nBecause you don't see me as a cop. None of you do.\nI didn't... I didn't think you'd make it this far.\nWe always thought you'd change your mind.\nI mean... you say a prayer every time you get on a escalator.\nWhy risk it?\nI just... never really saw you as a... as a cop.\nSorry.\nOh, there it is.\nOkay. Okay.\nYou know what? I know exactly what I have to do.\nI'm gonna tell her it's mine.\nWhat?! No. No.\nYes. Maybe I'm not supposed to be a cop.\nThere's no reason you should lose your job, too.\nI once changed a sign that said \"Happy Jewish New Year\" to \"Happy Newish Jew Year.\"\nIs that a hate crime? Stop talking, stop sweating.\nWhat is wrong with you people?! Enough!\nSarge, I have something I need to tell you.\nWait! Sergeant!\nMy name is Jessica Day, and this is my meth.\nDorado: What?!\nJess, No. I won't accept that. So...\nThe bathroom is covered in meth.\nMeth that belongs to me.\nAnd it may have intoxicated me through the skin on my breasts.\nBut I assure you, no one here had any prior knowledge of any of this.\nEspecially Winston.\nAnd I don't want him to go down for my mistake.\nYou'd be lucky to have him as a cop.\nTake me downtown to the all-lady fur factory.\nOkay, cuff me.\nSomebody bring me handcuffs. I'm guilty.\nIs she cuffing me?\nI can't see what's going on up there.\nDo you feel anything?\nDoes meth make you feel, like, normal, but, like... like your face feels, like, scratchy?\nOh, no, that's just the carpet on my face.\nHere's the way this is gonna go down.\nI'm gonna go in the bathroom, have a look around.\nYou will stay here.\nYou will not move, you will not talk, you will not think unless they're thoughts about not moving.\nWinston, I'm so sorry.\nI ruined everything.\nYou would have been such a good cop.\nYou would have made someone really lucky to have you as a partner.\nI always imagined I'd have a partner named Robertson.\nThat would have been perfect.\nYeah.\n\"Robertson, you're on the edge!\nYou've gone too far!\"\nNo, no, no.\nSee, the thing about me and Robertson is that we're tight.\nYou know, then I went ahead and slept with his wife.\nI don't know why...\nWhy would you do that?\nI don't know why I would do that. The job really gets to you.\nYou know, it's stressful out there.\nThis might not be the right moment but... for what it's worth, I did it.\nI kept a secret.\nWell, congratulations, Nick.\nYou have the willpower of a six-year-old.\nOh, thank you.\nI'm sorry about the whole kissing thing.\nOh, you don't have to apologize.\nI did... kiss you back a little.\nSo, should we tell Paul together?\nOh.\nWell, what do you think he's doing right now?\nDo you think he's explaining to the air-brusher that that really is his name? Paul?\nAnd that he wants that painted across the back of his denim jacket?\nIt's a normal name.\n(whispering): Hey, Nick?\nWhen I'm in prison, write, dance, sing... live your life.\nAnd if you come and visit me in jail, please don't wear that robe.\nIt's a kimono.\nWell, this is a first.\nThese are aquarium rocks.\nSo, that's the street name for...\nNo. These are actual aquarium rocks.\nYou were trying to flush rocks down your toilet.\nOh, what?!\nOh.\nOh, that's ridiculous.\nThat's great! Yes! Awesome!\nSo we're not going to prison?\n(Cece laughing)\nSo, did Winston pass the background check?\nOf course. He's one of our best cadets.\nHis test scores are high, he's passionate, hardworking.\nHe's gonna make one hell of a cop.\nBut he won't work in narcotics.\nYou get to be a cop!\nYay!\n(all chatting happily)\nCongrat... congrat... Congratulate...\nReally? No, we're celebrating Winston.\nCelebrating Winston. Okay.\nAll right, we'll celebrate Winston.\nOh.\nYeah.\nExcuse me. Please consider moving.\nI have no idea why you live with these people.\nWhat kind of person would urinate on an electrical socket?\nI... I thought it would make lightning.\nI told you that wouldn't work, Nick.\nCoach: Hey!\nGuess who's here like he normally is every Saturday!\nIt's Duquan!\nBig brother Wimstons.\nOh.\nI love you, Mr. Wimstons.\nI go from no hope to hope.\nHe take me and he says to me, \"You're gonna be somebody. You- You could be the presidents, or Statues of Liberties.\"\nIs that right?\nWe make homework togethers.\nHe buys me toys, and we chase each others, and we laugh at the sun.\nThis feels good, man.\nYeah.\nLike I got a new friend.\nMe, too.\nDuquan.\nRight.\nHanging out.\nIt's Jose, so...\nYeah, I like Duquan, though.\nYeah, but my name's Jose.\nLike outlet malls?\nI love outlet malls.\nAh, me, too, man.\nYeah.\nYeah. That's awesome.\nOn the weekend, though? Mm.\nYeah, but I mean, I have a strategy, you know.\nLike, I start out with a smoothie, and then do my leg stores first.\nThen, I... Yeah.\nI do the same, but I end it with pretzel.\nPretzel. I...\nShut up.\nCinnamon pretzel?\nOh, my God.\nDude, don't, don't,.\nNo, you don't.\nDon't.\nNo, you don't.\nYou want to play a tickle game?\n"}, {"title": "04x07 - Goldmine.txt", "script": "Gentlemen!\nThree months ago I bravely reentered the dating pool, and how has this city rewarded me?

The lion tamer.\nNever went out with a lion tamer.\nI am having some vivid dreams.\nThe point is Ian has asked me out on a third date, and this is the biggest compliment I could give.\nI want to go. Because I like him.\nBooh!\nThat's not a reason.\nAnd frankly it's been a while, and the third date is where, # mama gets her biscuit. #\n(chuckles)\nMama gets her biscuit.\nI don't understand.\nIt's sex.\nOh!\nYeah!\nNow, that's a reason!\nAnyway, I'm bringing him home tonight, so let's keep those toilets flushed.\nThat means stick around. Take a second look.\nHow'd you tell Ian about the fun surprise that you still live with your ex?\nAll right.\nWell, I haven't told him yet.\nUh, tricky conversation.\nI'm thinking of something simple like, Hey, Ian, I live with my ex.\nNo. No, no. When a guy hears that, he is going to run through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man.\nHere's a fun idea. You can put a hat on him with antlers.\nThis way, the hole he makes in the wall will make us all smile.\nNick brings home girls all the time.\nThere's no problem.\nNo complaints here.\nIt'll make you forget every botanical garden you've ever seen.\nI live with my ex-girlfriend.\nAnd after the farmer's market...\nI live with my ex.\nLet's have sex again.\nI live with my ex.\n(sighs)\nDamn it.

And disgusting.\nAnd I'm gonna steal some stuff.\nTake what you want, honey.\nCoach: We don't read those anymore.\n(door closes)\nNick, who are these girls?\nThey're not the best.\nJess, guys hate complicated situations.\nWe want the path of least resistance.\nThere's a flap in our underwear because we are too lazy to pull our underpants down.\nNo offense, Nick, but...\nIan's a little different from you or the women you bring home.\nThe... tavern folk.\nHave some respect.

They're great.\nYou really are a prince among men, Nick.\nAw, that's awfully nice. I feel like I'm maturing.\nAll I'm saying is that, somehow, Ian is even more mature than you are.\nAnd that's why I think he'll understand when I tell him in a mature adult way I live with my ex but there's nothing to worry about.\nCan I suggest a tweak?\nFine.\nI live with my ex but there's nothing to worry about because he's gay now.\nNo.\nBecause he has weeks to live.\nNo.\nBecause he's already dead.\nWhat?\nThen I'll act like a ghost.\nNo.\n(imitating ghost): Consider it.\nNo.\nCome on.\nThat's the worst ghost impression I've ever heard.\nThis is the worst ghost impression you've ever heard?\n(imitating ghost): I'm a ghost.\n(scoffs) There's way worse.\n(Winston humming softly)\nAnything for me?\nOh, no, this isn't our mail. This is our neighbors' mail.\nYou see, Viv likes it alphabetized.\nYet Michelle likes it according to size.

And nothing is less hot than a male secretary.\n(imitates record scratching)\nWhat?\nI think somebody needs to take a good long look at Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.\nDude's eyes are so pouchy he can barely see anything, and he's still killing it.\nGirls don't have sex with guys who sort their mail.\nI am playing the long game here, Coach, weaving myself into the fabric of their lives.\nPretty soon I'll be as permanent as the will that I helped them draw up.\nOh, Winston, thank God you're here.\nThe toilet won't flush.\nDid you jiggle the handle?\nNo, it's not working for us.\nHere.\nOh.\nI'm not here to do any chores.\nYou guys want to hang out tonight?\nSure.\nSure.\nRight on.\nRight on. That's what's up.\nWinston: Coach, I really need my stilts and a plunger!\nEh, I don't care.\nI'm happy to lend you a bra, but I don't think I have anything that would fit you.\nThat's the Peter Pan.\nThat'll smash 'em down good, but you'll never get those in there.\nI know. I just wanted to see what it would feel like to be your size.\nAre we doing, like, a boob Freaky Friday?\nBecause I don't want to lug yours around. They're a load.\nI know. That's the whole point.

There are five stages of grief.\nStage one was denial.\nThis is not happening, this is not...\nYes, it is. Yes, it is.\nYou're not getting a boob reduction.\nYes, I am.\nThis is not happening.\nYes, it is.\nStage two was anger.\nYour breasts belong to all of us!\nOkay.\nWho are you to decide?!\nNext will be stage four, depression.\nAnd then stage five, acceptance.\nBut right now, I'm firmly planted in stage three, bargaining.\nDear God, if you stop Cece's breast reduction, Okay.\nI'll circumcise Coach.\nWhoa, Coach.\nGo out with them tonight? Doesn't make any sense, man.\nAnd compromise the long game? Ha.\nNot until I replace their rocker switches with dimmers.\nForget your long game, Winston! Getting a girl to have sex with you is not about planning ahead.\nIt is about seizing opportunities that you never saw coming. It is instinct.\nAll right? It is improv.\nIt is jazz, man.\nBut with words. You dig? And the words are, Oh, yeah, girl, I'm about to...\n(scatting loudly)\n(phone vibrating)\n(humming quietly)\n(chuckles) Glen, my man, tell me something good.\nAnd you better not be trying to sell me some non-dimmable halogens, you son of a...\nWhere you at? Are you kidding me?\n(sighs)\nHey, buddy.\nYou know what you need to surround yourself with tonight?\nFour new boobs.\nOn two different women?\nYou're damn right.\nTake me to them.\n(laughs)\nUm, do you want to, like, go find a bar, grab a drink?\nThere's a bar that I like.\nIt's called... my place.\nGreat. Uh, is it... You think it'll be crowded?\nYou know I'm talking about my house, right?\nOkay. Yeah, no, I wasn't... I thought that was just a clever name but now I do.\nNo.\nAnd, yeah, let's go there.\n(laughs)\nUm, one thing I want to, uh, disclose to you in a very mature adult way, I... live with my ex.\nOkay. Uh, yeah, you live with your ex.\nYeah.\nBut also three other guys.\nIt's more zany than sexy.\nOkay. So it, like, wasn't really serious?\nOh, it was very serious.\nDid you say I love you?\nNot until he said it. (chuckles)\nUh, yeah, I don't think I can do this.\nI'm sorry. I just...\nWhat?\nI've been on so many weird dates lately. I'm just looking for something easier.\nI... No, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, look.\nYes, I live with my ex.\nBut there's nothing to worry about.\nBecause...\nNick. You're gay.\nHuh?\nYou're gay.\nBe gay. Be gay. Be gay.\nBe gay?\nHey. (chuckles)\nI just had to make sure these animals flushed.\nOh. Not you, you fastidious queen.\nOh, y-you must be Nick.\nWell, friends call me Gay Nick.\nMy perfect Sunday, sitting here watching the game, eating a pot pie with a hot dude with no shirt on, on my lap kissing me.\nRight on, man. Right on, man.\nAll right.\nYou got it.\n(imitates explosion)\nUh, can I use your restroom?\nYeah. It's down the hall to the right.\nDon't worry. I won't peek.\nBut he wants to.\n(chuckles)\nOh, my God, I am so sorry.\nI should just tell him the truth.\nIt's too late for the truth, Jess.\nYou live with a gay man, and this gay man's gonna help you get laid.\nOkay. Thank you.\nYou're welcome.\nDo you think you can play a gay man?\nI'm terrible at lying, I'm terrific at make-believe.\nOkay.\nOkay? But I need to know some backstory 'cause it's very important to me.\nOkay. Yeah, backstory's important.\nOkay.\nTell me, have I always known I was gay, or did I just recently realize it?\nThat's... Um, you-you always knew you were gay, but you grew up in an oil town where masculinity was the most valued currency.\nUm, you-you had an older brother named Chip.\nAnd Chip was a union guy.\nYes.\nAnd if it wasn't about Teamster Local 11, Chip didn't want to hear about it.\nOh, my God, we're doing this.\nWhen I came out, was it flashy?\nWas it emotional?\nAm I mad that Anderson Cooper doesn't fly the flag?\nOr for what he's doing in his own way... is it even braver?\nThese are all really good questions, but I just can't get my mind off, like, why you dress this way.\nWhy aren't you in better shape?\nDon't put me in a box!\nThere's nothing we gay men hate more than being put in a box.\nLook, maybe I'm a bear, maybe I'm a twinkler.\nThat's not a category.\nI like rugby for the game and for the men.\nNow, if you excuse me, I got to go do that gay thing I was telling you about, because, of course, I'm gay as hell.\n(laughs) Bye.\n(whispers): That's not how gay men talk.\n(whispers): I am shattering stereotypes.\nWhat are you doing here, man?\n[b]Winston: I'm always here.\nVery definition of the long game.\nCoach: Forget your long game. It doesn't...\nWhat is he...?\nWhat are you doing, man?\nIs this...?\nIs this the fut... the future?\nI can hold them both in one hand.\nYeah, man.\n(sighs)\nNo, no, there it is. Look at that.\nStage four... depression.\nMy two best friends are going away.\nGoing away far too soon.\nAnd if you were lucky enough to meet them, to touch them, to be touched by them, you came away a better person.\nIf you'll excuse me.\nIs he... is he talking about you guys?\nYes. Yes, he is, uh... he's talking about us.\nWe are, unfortunately, we're going away... tomorrow.\nSo, uh, we better make tonight count, huh, ladies?\nWait.\nWe barely got to know you!\nHow long will you be gone?\nFor... for... 44 weeks.\n44 weeks?\nTell them about our business, man.\nYou don't have to be shy about it.\nUh, right.\nNo. Yeah.\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\nHello. Do you like socks?\nWe sell socks.\nEverybody likes socks.\nI just cried on my penis while I was peeing.\nWhoa.\nSchmidt: That happened.\nI just can't stop thinking about them.\n(sighs)\nYou know, there are some people that are gonna say that they... they look alike.\nThat they're exactly the same. And you know what?\nThey just don't know them like I know them.\nTruth-truth be told?\nOne of them...\nOne of them is slightly more brown than the other.\nAnd they're so unique, and they're so special.\nYou know what I'm gonna miss most about them?\nWatching them bounce.\nWatching them...\nWatching them bounce.\nIf you just give me a chance to exp...\nWell, easy come, easy go.\nEasy? Easy?!\nYou just stole six months of my life, man.\nI am... I am P.O.'d, hombre!\nWinston!\nCan I get a high five?\nBam.\n(laughs)\nSorry I called you a biscuit.\nI'm sorry I liked it so much. (laughs)\n(knocking) NICK: Hey, Jess, you in there?\nIs that Nick?\nDo you mean Gay Nick?\nYeah, that's Gay Nick.\nI am so sorry.\nWhat's going on?\nI screwed up. (door opens)\nA girl, Nick?\nI know.\nNick, really?\n(laughs): Hey.\n(laughs)\nYou look like my dead friend Karen.\nDoes anyone ever tell you that?\nHmm, no.\nThank you.\nMm.\n(door closes) What?!\nI wanted to be gay for you, I really did, but it's a very hard time to be gay.\nGirls are wearing scarves and boots.\nThey have so many layers to them.\nWhat is underneath all those layers? I want to find out!\nAre you blaming autumn?\nLook, it was one night. Get rid of her!\nI tried. I told her I live with my ex, and she didn't care.\nYou look so cute in the morning. (laughs)\nYou talking to me or her? (laughter)\n(door closes) Okay. I'll get rid of her.\nI'll just pretend to be your crazy ex-girlfriend.\nI can do this. I did a one-woman production of A Christmas Carol.\n(British accent): You, sir, what day is it?\nAye, it's Christmas day.\nThat was not good.\nIt was perfect.\nThank you. I thought you'd think that.\nYeah, it's perfect.\nAll right, look, you stay here and keep your gay warm, okay?\nIn case Ian comes back. Also, can we agree that this is not the most mature way to handle things?\nEven though it's pretty fun.\nIt's no fun a couple Bellinis and a round of apples to apples can't solve.\nWhat kind of gay are you?\nI'm still finding it.\nAll right.\nAll right.\nNick thinks we're broken up, but he also thinks that the last girl he slept with wasn't me in a wig.\n(laughs)\nWigs are so good for tricking guys.\nI'm around all the time.\nDo you really want to get yourself in this situation?\nMy last boyfriend was, like, honestly in his 80s.\nI was just like, Don't die, Myron.\nDoes that answer your question?\nTell me everything you did sexually!\nEverything! All of it, or leave!\nI put my finger...\nStop!\nBut you asked...\nNo.\nI-I did, but it backfired.\nWinston: Ah, so it is load bearing, huh?\nWhat are you doing?\nMe? Oh, well, first, I'm putting up the shelves.\nThen I got to finish the floor, so that the shelves can appear level, then the ceiling.\nEnough! All right? You've done enough for these women.\nLook, ladies, I tried to manipulate you, and I am sorry about that, but you guys have been manipulating my friend for months.\nIt is not okay. Just dangling sex like a little carrot.\nWe are not using sex to get Winston to do stuff.\nNo.\nWait. You're not?\nNo.\nWell, then he's done doing stuff.\nCome on, Winston. You're better than this.\nForget you guys.\nWait!\nYeah, just-just give us a minute.\nOkay, we have to talk about...\nOkay.\nWhat are they whispering about?\nI don't know.\nWe could just stack the books.\nNo... No.\nOh, man, this is embarrassing.\nUh...\nOkay. It's me.\nCome on.\nWhat?\nWait. Listen. Um...\nMichelle, you don't have to do this.\nThat's okay. I kind of want to.\nJust, uh, keep the pencil behind your ear, and bring the hard hat, um, and the safety goggles.\n(whispers): Long game.\n(sighs)\nWonder what's taking, uh, Jess so long.\nWell, you know women.\nWhat's women?\n(laughs)\n(laughs): Am I right?\nWhat's women?\nI just don't know them like you know them, is my point.\nUh-huh.\nUh, so, what kind of guys do you like to date?\nMe? All kinds.\nYeah.\nHunks. If I can get my, uh, paws on a hunk, I don't let go.\nUh, ripped nerds.\n'Cause they're smart but strong, I guess.\nUh-huh.\nI like Spanish guys.\nThrow in a little, uh, hint of German in there, there's a perfect combo.\nOkay.\nCertain ice cream men, I guess.\nCarpet steamers. Sleepy guys.\nUh, we in the gay community call them drowsers.\nWhy would you like a sleepy guy?\nLook... I'm so out of the game...\nI'm in a relationship.\nUm... he's got a nice penis.\nYou're sweating a lot.\nThat's what he said! Am I right?\n(laughs)\nI'm a sweaty lover, is what he says to me.\nOkay, you know, you really don't seem gay.\nI don't buy it.\nHey. Not now.\nProbably wondering why I didn't come home last night.\nJust needed some space to process this whole thing.\nI'm sorry if our room felt empty.\n(sighs)\nWell, it did.\nI was really worried about you.\nSo where were you? You owe me that much.\nI just went walking on the streets last night.\nI needed to come to terms with all this.\nEnded up in a park. I know that's stupid, but I promise I was careful.\nI mean, I was totally safe.\nA park?\nI don't know, man.\nHey, I'm upset... but I understand.\nIt's okay.\nCome here.\nCome here.\n(sighs) There, there.\nThanks.\nYeah.\nAcceptance. Wow.\nYeah.\nGive me a kiss.\nJust give me a kiss.\nAll right?\nI felt like you needed that more than I did.\n(sighs)\nYou're scruff, by the way, is perfect.\nDon't touch your beard trimming setting.\nOkay.\nTake it easy.\nOkay.\nThat was beautiful.\nI'm-I'm sorry, you know?\nI think I'm just more used to, like, stereotypical gay guys, like him, you know?\nYou offended me.\nI'm sorry.\nIan! Ian! Hi. There are some events that are about to occur that I'd like to get ahead of.\nUm, the truth is that Nick is...\nOh, God.\nGet off of me!\nYou're not a man!\nIan! Wait. I'm so sorry I lied, and you don't owe me anything, but could I just ask you one thing before you leave?\nWhat is this, an exit interview?\nIs there any good way I could have told you about my living situation?\nOkay, you know what? Fair question. Um... no!\nLook, Nick was just trying to help me. Clearly, he would do anything for you. I mean, he went so far as to hire an actual gay man to play his cheating lover.\nWhat? Oh, my God. You know what?\nI think that was Schmidt.\nHe's... not gay.\nWhen are the lies gonna stop?!\nNow, this is just a consultation, so do your best to relax.\nOkay.\nStop the surgery!\nThis is just a consultation.\nMay we have the room, please?\nThat's what it's here for.\nI'm sorry.\nWhat are you doing?!\nOkay, look, I know I can't stop this, and I accept that, but I just wanted to stop it long enough so that I could say good-bye.\nAw. Look, this is a low-risk procedure, okay?\nI'm gonna be fine.\nOh, you meant say good-bye to my boobs.\nI forgot who I was talking to.\nNo, Schmidt, you cannot see my boobs.\nI need to look them in the eyes. I can't let them leave without knowing how much they've meant to me.\nI'll let them know.\nNo.\nI need to tell them myself.\n(groans) All right... you can say good-bye to one, all right?\nI mean, j-just one?\nOne.\n(sighs) Gosh almighty.\nThe Ultimate Sophie's Cho-Cho.\nI mean, there's Harold, who's just... full of life...\n(groans)\n(sighs) And Kumar, who's shy.\nWho's shy, but yet surprisingly so brave.\nBut, you know, who wouldn't be with a best friend like Harold?\nOh, my God, fine!\nYou can say good-bye to both, okay?\nOkay. I need you to put these on.\nWhat?\nThis is a private conversation that doesn't concern you.\nThe playlist... matches the mood.\n(Canon in D playing)\n(music fades)\nI mean, I guess if I'm being honest, it doesn't matter what size you are. I'm always gonna love you, because you're attached to the most beautiful person in the whole world.\n(music resumes)\nYou know what I think? I think that when people go on dates with us, probably talk to their friends and their friends say, You go on dates with a lot of weirdos.\n(shower running)\nOh, my God. We're the weirdo ass clowns.\nAw, no. Everyone in their 30s waits in line for the shower.\nI'm sorry, but the truth is, as long as you live with me, you're not gonna meet a normal guy.\n(Jess chuckles)\nWhy are you guys all in here?\nWinston's taking a long-ass shower.\nPoor guy gets dirty.\nAll right, let me see the new.\nI accept it.\nAgain, it was just a consultation. And actually, I don't even know if I'm gonna go through with it.\nYou're still here. I saved you.\nI'm your Schindler. One day, your children are gonna put rocks on my grave.\nHey, uh, wow. You guys mind if I get cuts? 'Cause I am very dirty.\nWait a minute.\nWho's in the sh...\nHey, what's the vibe here on shower pee-pee?\nI'm just trying to plan my day.\nWho is this woman?!\nYou have awesome water pressure. You should see what's falling out of my hair.\nWell, Nick... looks like you're gonna have to marry her.\nIt's looking that way, isn't it?\nYeah.\nShe's not so bad.\nShe's peeing in the shower.\nYeah, she is.\n(laughs) That's weird.\nClassic Tina."}, {"title": "04x08 - Teachers.txt", "script": "Oh, the female reproductive system.\nKind of looks like the Chicago Bulls symbol.\nIt does.\nNow, this is the only part that matters.\nThe money train. Sure.\nHey, I call it my nine-to-five.\n'Cause it's my job to work it. You know what I'm saying?\n(laughter)\nThe large intestine, you degenerates.\nWhat?\nLet me see that.\nI told Jess that I don't want to teach health.\nI'm not good at it. Such a hassle.\nStudying, planning, giving weak kids good grades. No.\nI heard that. There are good things, too. Like you get to come with me to a dope two-day teaching conference in Palmdale.\nI want to stay and hang out with the guys at Guys' Night. - What's Guys' Night?\nOh, yeah, we're celebrating you being gone. No offense.\nGuys' Night!\nGuys' Night!\nGuys' Night!\nThe conference is gonna be really fun. We just have to work from, like, 9:00 to 7:00.\nAnd then after that it's a par-tay.\nUntil 10:00, when quiet hours are strictly enforced.\nBut before then we rage. For three hours.\nActually, two because there's the half an hour of setup time and the half an hour of cleanup time because we have to actually be in bed at 10:00.\nCece: Ooh!\nAre you kidding me?\nRyan is going?\nRyan-Ryan? The guy you have a crazy crush on?\nI had a crush on him. Principal Foster says that administrators can't date teachers. It's forbidden.\nThat makes it so much hotter.\nIt makes it crazy hotter. But, look, it's not just about Principal Foster.\nThis is about how I worked really hard to get to Vice Principal, and I'm not gonna let some British guy get in my way.\nSome redcoat bastard.\nThat's why I keep all of our interactions strictly professional.\nHey. How was your weekend?\nThat's personal.\nI can't risk learning any personal details about him.\nWhat if he taught his dyslexic sister how to read?\nI can't know that. I'll go crazy with lust.\nMy pants will turn to ash.\nAnd so exactly how do you plan to avoid this man that you are trapped in the same hotel with?\nThere are, like, a thousand porns that start that way.\nYeah, but no porns have teachers.\nEvery p0rn has a teacher.\nWell, I'm not worried, okay?\n'Cause I'll probably never even see him.\nJess?\nCan you believe we're right next to each other?\nHey, you guys want sangria?\nIt's Guys' Night!\nOnly beer!\nYeah, what is this, Spain?\nGreat sangria burn, man.\nReally?\nNever let your guard down!\nAah!\nOh, takedown!\nNever let your guard down.\nWell played.\nAll right, first up, we eat meat.\nHow much meat?!\nThen we take a fart nap.\nNot for me. Pass.\nAll right, guys, it's Guys' Night. Let's think.\nOkay.\nAnything else we can't do when Jess is here.\nWow.\nLook at that stretching.\nI don't want to... make this sound too creepy, but I want to own those girls.\nI wouldn't touch them. They'd want for nothing. But I would know they were there.\nStretching. For me.\nI want to French braid that girl hair.\nI want to French braid that hair so good.\nThe third hottest one just waved at me. Hello!\nAh!\nOoh!\nOh, no.\nOh!\nNo!\nNo, no, no!\nOh...\n-Jess is gonna kill you.\nShoot! She's not gonna kill me.\nI'm just gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have it cleaned, I'll have it cleaned.\nSchmidt, red wine sets.\nShut up, Winston! It sets.\nWhy don't you just wash it?\nWhy don't I just what?\nWash it.\nJust wash the blanket.\nUnless you can't.\nCome on, man. Get out of here.\nI've known you for a lot of years and I've never seen you do laundry.\nNever seen me do laundry... Get out of town.\nWait, wait. Is that true?\nCome on, you guys, this is so...\nReally, this is silly.\nThen do it.\nRight now.\nWe'll watch.\nDoing the laundry...\nIt's no problemo.\nLittle bit of this.\nWhat in the world...?\nStraining the soap.\nGet that in there.\nBack in there.\nUm, okay.\nAnd...\nThat's it. Laundry.\nCan't... Oh, so silly.\nForgot to put the quarters in.\nThat's right, the quarters.\nSchmidt...\nAll right!

Hmm?\nWhat?\nWhat are you talking about?\nWhat are you talking about?\nI need you to be my buffer between Ryan and me.\nHe's so sexy.\nReally?\nYeah.\nThat guy?\nBeautiful. Did you make that?\nLooks like a Boys Department mannequin.\nYeah.\nHey, Jess, can I, um...\nNope.\nNo time for chatting.\nWe have to sit down.\nYou can't sit there.\nCoach likes to sit in the middle.\nMm-hmm.\nI sit bitch or I don't sit at all.\n(whispering): You're weird.

She looks like one of those ladies who talks you into having a baby in a tub.\nYou. the talker.\nMmm...\nStand up.\nTalk to us.\nThere were other people talking, I just want to let you know that.\nWhy are you a teacher?\nUh, 'cause my... my roommate made me.\nHmm.\nWhat?\nI'm worried about you.\nYou're a worry.\nWor... why, why are you worried about me?\nTeaching is an awesome responsibility.\nYou are not prepared for it. Sit down.\nOkay.\nToday, we will learn about our fellow educators, their hopes, their dreams, their bitter regrets.\nThe things they wish they'd said to their birth mother...\nSo, partner up.\nWill you be my partner?\nMmm, sorry, I'm with Coach.\nNo, I can't do it.\nI'm going to the bar.

It wasn't till after birth that the trouble really began.\nHere we go.\nSchmidt: Nana wouldn't let me in the laundry room.\nI think it's because my hands were always covered in butter.\nAnd so I went to college unable to do laundry.\nI'm making jean shorts!\nI'm doing laundry!\nBig day for both of us!\nYeah, it is.\nAs I pulled out my maternity corduroys, I spied a six-pack of Pi-Phis.\nI need... um...\nI need them loose to keep... to keep my sperm count up.\nYou know how it is!\nEventually, the window of time when it was acceptable to learn something so basic had closed.\nI was an adult.\nIt was too late.\nWell, I understand.\nYou know, I've never told anyone this, but, um...\nI don't know how to read a ruler.\nI don't, I mean, how do you start?\nAt the edge or the first tick?\nIt's confusing to me.\nAre you serious?\nDo you know how to count?\nIt always gets on top of me, and 'Cause then you should know how to use a ruler, you idiot!\nI'm an idiot? You can't even wash your own underwear, you dumbass.\nHey! They're both super easy!\nWe're talking about laundry and a ruler!\nI'm gonna teach you guys right now!\nLet's go.\nEach of you holds a stack of cards with questions for your partners.\nYou must uncover the answers. Begin.\nWhat gets you out of bed in the morning?\nLet me guess.\nYour mother, who you live with, says, Ryan, your crumpets are getting cold.\nThe thought that any ordinary day could be the day I look back on when I'm much older as being the best day of my life.\nYou?\nSame.\nDon't look away.\nEmbrace the intimacy...\nI'm good.\nEmbrace the intimacy.\nOkay.\nYou know, I think there's an art to a picnic basket.\nApricot jam would never go with a sesame cracker.\nOf course it wouldn't, it would go with Both: a flaky baguette.\nDuck, duck. Okay, now step forward, step forward, another step forward; okay, go to your right, go to your right.\nDo you scrapbook?\nOn rainy days.\nStep forward, go to your left; left, left.\nBig step, that's it, big step; now come to me, another big step; come to me.\nDo you own yarn?\nSpools of it.\nI craft so much.\nIt's a left, and again come to me, come to me.\nYes.\nCome to me.\nOh!\nOh!\nIt's okay, I've got you.\nWe have a new record.\nHe's amazing.\nI think he might be an angel sent down to Earth like Denzel Washington in The Preacher's Wife.\nOh, honey, okay, what can I do?\nIn your purse, you will find a white envelope.\nOkay, you, you wrote a letter to yourself, and stuck it in my purse?\nRead it, I need to hear it.\nDear Jess, If you are reading this, it's because you're being an idiot and developing feelings for your employee, you ballet-flat-wearing piece of Oregon trash.\nYou are so right. You are so right.\nTo have intercourse with the first man hired under your reign would be an insult to yourself and also...\nThis part's in caps.\n...all women everywhere.\nAll women everywhere.\nDid you learn nothing from the movie Elizabeth, you stupid little bitch?\nNo one respects a queen who sleeps with her subjects.\nI will paint my face white.\nNo man may have me.\nThank you, Cece.\nYou're welcome?\nTeaching is such a pain in the ass.\nIsn't it?\nI'll tell you what, I wouldn't give it up for anything.\nYou get to really impact those kids' lives.\nI'm not gonna impact them, I'm just teaching health.\nJust health?\nHey, Carol.\nHey, Ned.\nOh, it's Carol.\nOh, hey, Carol.\nHealth is the most important subject.\nScrew up, and they just get pregnant.\nWhat's your safe sex lesson plan?\nI don't know!\nUh, lie to them and say condoms feel good?\nUh, maybe tell them about my buddy who's got bumps on his thing?\nMaybe bring up Magic Johnson.\nMaybe bring up Kobe Bryant.\nYou're my best friend in the whole world, but I'm really worried about you.\nYou think the line is a suggestion?\nI don't know what it is...\nIt isn't!\nDo it again.\nIt's too hard!\nDo it again!\nOkay, so you start with the first tick.\nOh...\nThat's it, really.\nStop!\nThat was at the line!\nThat was perfect.\nNow do it ten more times.\nSo in the beginning, you never mind the edge.\nYeah.\nMan.\nYou got to hold on to it.\nWhat about bleach?\nLet's walk before we can run, huh, pal?\nHey, Winston, he's asking about bleach!\n(laughs) Man, that is way too soon.\nWarm-warm, warm-cold...\nYou got this, don't get flustered!\nCold-cold, hot-cold, hot-hot?

I don't know what you're talking about.\nYes, you do. You've been avoiding me for weeks at school.\nThat's why I was so happy that we were finally getting a chance to, I don't know, maybe get to know each other.\nWhat, is this summer camp?\nWe don't need to get to know each other.\nWhat's your problem with me?\nDid I do something to offend you?\nWhy do...

I feel like I hear a baby.\nAll right, gentlemen... bar crawl.\nMan, look at this, I know how to do laundry!\nI feel like a new man.\nGood, good, good.\nThere is no way for me to express my joy.\nExcept by telling you the width of my smile.\n(giggles)\n(chuckles)\nI can't read it, somebody else read it.\nNo, I want to do it, I want to do it, hold on.\nBut I can't see, let me turn it... uh...\nYou know what? To Nick.\nWhat can't you do?\nA lot, you know, I can't say Frebuary.\n(laughs) No one can!\nFrebuar... Febuar-ar...\nFeb.. I... (babbles)\nWhatever.\nFeb... February.\nYeah, it's February.\nI can't say the alphabet unless I'm singing the song.\nAnd I never learned how to love.\nBut enough about me... Guys' Night!\nLet's go, gentlemen.\nWinston: Man, that is... that is heavy.\nHey, Nick, that's something we should talk about.\nI mean, what are we gonna do, sit around all night and talk about love?\n(laughs)\nWinston and Schmidt:  I want to know what love is \n I want you to show me \n Ooh... \n I want to know what love is \n Oh... \n And I want you to sh... \n I know you can show me \nSad song.\nHey, buddy.\nHey!\nJess: What's happening?\nI freaked out about the whole teaching health thing, and then I went and I-I got drunk with Ned...\nNeddy!\nAnd then I bet everybody in the bar that I could do a backflip off the roof, and that's what I came to do.\nSo...\nHey, look, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\nUh, I... I totally understand how you're feeling.\nYeah? Does, uh, teaching scare the crap out of you, Jess?\nWell, it is my life's calling, so, no.\nExactly.\nYou don't get it.\nI do.\nWhat's up, player?\nIt's the British dude.\nThis is my first time teaching, and I'm scared, too.\nIt's a terribly important job.\nYeah, but health is the most... (all gasping)\nI'm good.\nHealth is the most important subject on Earth.\nYes, it is important.\n'Cause you know kids, they're always wanting to have sex with each other.\nThey don't know that it just feels good for a second and then you're sad.\nAnd that's why we need someone great, someone strong, who the kids trust.\nOkay.\nSomeone who can yell at them about chlamydia.\nThat does... that sounds like... like something Coach would do.\nYou can teach.\nI can teach, guys!\nThat's mostly what I was trying to tell you.\nNo one needs to worry about me anymore!\nNo! (all screaming)\nOh, my God.\nI'll get him.\nNo.\nYes.\nDon't do anything heroic right now.\n(all gasp, exclaim)\n(gasping for air)\n(cheering)\nThis guy's amazing.\nNick, Winston and Schmidt:  Hello \n Is it me you're looking for? \n I can see it in your... \nI want to be the someone that somebody is looking for.\n- In your smile... \nBut what do I have to offer?\nDo not talk about yourself like that.\nCome on, guys, what do I bring to the table?\nThat's easy, man.\nYou're the cute one.\nWhat?\nThat's right.\nLook, I'm the smart one, Winston's the silly one, Coach is the sports one, and you're the cute one.\nWell, if I were so cute, then how come I can't find anyone to love?\n'Cause you're aiming too low.\nNick, my man, you don't find diamonds underground.\nThat's exactly where you find diamonds, Winston.\nLet's... can we not...\nThis is not about gems, okay?\nThis is about Nick valuing himself enough to aim for the top.\nNow, I-I've been to the top of the mountain, with Cece, and it was glorious up there.\nAnd you know, one of these days... could be tomorrow...\nI'm gonna be a millionaire.\nIf I don't have Cece, then what do I have?\nYou got a million dollars.\nIf I'm being honest, you guys, uh...\nI'm worried about being a cop.\nSure.\nYou know, what if I see something really bad and then it... it changes me?\nYou know, it makes me lose my faith and then I become really bad?\nYou guys really think I'm the cute one?\nYou know what's not cute?\nPretending that you don't know that you are.\nSchmidt, this sangria is just delicious.\nThanks, man.\nI'm jealous of that little orange in there.\nIt gets to just drink all the sangria it wants.\nYeah. I'm probably gonna...\nI'm gonna eat the orange, too.\nGuys' Night.\nGuys' Night!\n(blowing)\n(whistles)\n(whistles)\nIt's like instant world music.\n(tones harmonizing)\n(laughing)\nWait, shh.\nWhy shh?\nI think he's finally...\n(Coach snores) asleep.\nAsleep.\n(giggles)\nCheers.\nChin-chin.\nUm...\nHey...\nI'm sorry.\nI was a little bit of a jerk to you earlier.\nNo, it's fine.\nI'm used to jerks.\nI used to work in finance.\nOh! Finance!\nMm-hmm.\nReally?\nWhy did you leave?\nI know this sounds silly, but I realized that the only time I'd been really happy in my life was teaching my little sister how to read.\nShe suffers from crippling dyslexia.\nOh, God!\nWhat?\nYou're just... so perfect.\nWell, it's more common than you might think.\nNo, you're like the most perfect person I've ever met. And it's like you're an angel who's been sent down to the Earth, like... have you ever seen the movie The Preacher's Wife?\nAnyway, I just have this big, stupid crush on you.\nI... didn't say that.\nNo, it's fine. It's-it's...\nShouldn't have said... No.\nI shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry, um...\nI need a bucket.\nNow!\nUm, you should go.\nI need a bucket!\n(gags) Just go.\nNo, let me help, please. Let me help.\nNo, just go, just go, just go.\nCoach: Ugh, gettin' the mouth sweats.\nOh, I need a bucket!\nJust go.\nJust go. Just go.\nOkay.\nWhy is there ice in here?\nMore room... (sighs) for what's about to happen...\nOh, God...\nOh, my God!\nWhen I get home I'm hitting the books.\nI am going to crush health.\nYeah, you are.\nYeah.\nNed!\nLet me get his contact before we leave.\nWhat?\nNed! I need details, bro!\nHey, man. Am I gonna get your e-mail?\nWhat's gonna happen here?\nYeah, let's do it, let's do it.\nLet's do it, let's do it.\nYeah.\nIt's therealned8(a)guhmail.com.\nAt guhmail... you mean Gmail?\nOh, is that how you say it?\nUm... (chuckles)\nGood morning.\nGood morning.\nCan I, um... talk to you about last night?\nNo, I want to talk to you about last night, because I said some things, um, that don't reflect how I really feel about you.\nUm... so I'd really appreciate it if you could strike them from the record.\nIt was the conference talking, not me.\nConsider them struck.\nThank you.\nEnjoy your Thanksgiving vacation.\nIt's, uh, an American holiday where we celebrate the fact that we... didn't know how to farm by ourselves.\nAre you curious to know how I really feel about you?\nNo.\nBecause if you were interested, I'd tell you that I won't enjoy my Thanksgiving because I won't get to see you every day.\nI think you're beautiful and totally insane, and when I'm at work, I can't focus, because I can't get you out of my head.\nCoach: Hey.\nHey, uh, you guys want to stop on the way home and get some pancakes?\nHey, what do you call them in England?\nRoundy-yums.\nReally?\nNo.\nSee you after the holidays.\nOh, boy.\nYou didn't see anything!\nWhere'd your lipstick go?\nHit 'em! Hit 'em!\nFrom the back.\nHit 'em!\nUgh!\nIt smells terrible in here!\nHow many beers did you guys drink?\nSo much.\nBeer, beer! Lots of beer.\nJust a lot of beer.\nThat's how beer smells.\nSo many beers.\n(sniffs)\nSmells like sangria.\nSchmidt: That must be the perfume from all the ladies we hooked up with. Yeah.\nMm-hmm.\nThey were all Spaniards.\nWinston: Mine was named Se\u00f1orita Lucinda Madrid.\nSay, how was the conference?\nIt was just... stupid... conferences...\nUgh.\nSo, she finally hooked up with Ryan.\nHe put his teeth behind her teeth.\nWow!\nAah!\nOh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\nWhat the hell did you guys do to my blanket?"}, {"title": "04x09 - Thanksgiving IV.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nFriends, ex-girlfriend, Winston, months ago I warned you that winter was coming.\nAnd for the cold and wretched days ahead, I stressed our need to take lovers and take them quickly.\nJess: Your head is huge.\n(chuckles) Your hat's the size of a garbage can.\nNick: You look great in that hat, man. What a hunk.\nJess: You look like Jewish Pharrell.\nTh-Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Okay, now, winter is now here.\nAnd I vow that we will not miss our final opportunity for sexual realization in 2014.\nDid you steal my belt buckle, you Silly Billy?\nEnough out of you, Winston!\nSilly Billy? Dude.\nIf you unzipped your face and an old white woman popped out, I would not be shocked.\nReally?\nNo.\nI would.\nI would be very surprised.\nThat is why this year we will not be celebrating Thanksgiving.\nInstead, we will be celebrating...\nRemember last Thanksgiving when I almost died?\n(others agreeing, chattering)\nBangsgiving! We'll be celebrating Bangsgiving!\nWhy can't you let me just have this, you guys? Please.\nOkay. You've been talking about this for, like, a week, Schmidt.\nWe get it. Let's just pick names already. Jess, I can't believe that you are into Bangsgiving.\nI just want to meet a guy so I can forget about Ryan.\nJust date him, Jess.\n'Cause I'm his boss, and it's against the rules for me to date him.\nJust date him. It's a dumb rule.\nIt's against the rules.\nTake the hat.\nOh.\nNow, whosever name you pick, that's who you'll be bringing a date for.\nAnd no date leaves until everyone is laid.\nI just want to meet a nice fella.\nCan I have permission to send them home without sex?\nNo, you do not.\nI think everybody's date should be able to leave.\nNick: Yeah, your plan sounds a little kidnappy.\nWhat's the rule on that, Winston?\nEh, gray area. We're good.\nWinston is in. My man. And, okay, nobody say who you picked. It'll ruin the surprise.\nOh, crap. You picked me.\nNo! How'd you know?\nAnd now you're gonna set me up with you, aren't you?\nCece, I-I know that this holiday is a bittersweet memory for your people, Wrong kind of Indian. but, please, do not take that out on me.\nOkay, well, I picked you, too, so I want to re-pick.\nNo re-picking. And no more telling.\nSo, listen up, uh, for whoever picked me, I just want you to know that I have really gotten into feet lately, so do with that what you will.\nNo one do anything with that.\nCan I just say no mustaches?\nI'd like someone tall.\nShe's got to have an ass.\nCan I just reiterate the whole feet thing?\nI want to say who I picked so bad.\nI'm looking for a fake redhead. With a medium-sized neck.\nI just want to be slapped around.\nSo, Pearl, I told Winston that you work at my school.\nAnd, um, Winston is about to become a cop, which you've probably already gathered from the fact that he pinned his badge to his sport coat.\nWhat? (chuckles)\nHow did that get there?\nLet me freshen your drink. (chuckles)\nExcuse me a second.\n(whispering): Hey, Coach. Coach.\nLook at what Jess brought me.\nOh, Pearl? Yeah, she's great, man.\nHey, come here. You got something on your face.\nReally? What is it?\nIt's, like, right...\nWhat were you thinking, bringing me that girl from the police academy?\nWhat's wrong with Pepper?\nAllow me...\n(chuckles) Arms!\nShe's jacked, dude. You should've warned me you were setting me up with one of the Guardians of the Galaxy.\nI'm sure she's not that bad.\nWhoa.\nWhere was she when I was cracking walnuts for the stuffing?\nLook, she's fantastic. She's beautiful.\nYou're gonna love her.\nNow, if you jerks will excuse me, this Bishop's got to capture himself a queen.\nShe's doing push-ups.\nFor your lady.\nThank you. Thank you very much, Jess.\nPearl, she's... Yeah, she's great.\nWhat grade does she teach?\nOh, she doesn't teach. She's the lunch lady.\nYou said the lunch lady?\nYeah.\nSo where exactly is this \"date\" of mine?\nAll right, I invited Lucy, like you asked.\nYour date's name is Geoff and he will be here. By the way, he spells Geoff with a \"G,\" so you know he comes from money.\nNick: Well, I think the real difference is crocodiles are man-eaters and alligators...\nWhat in the bloody hell?\nUh, hey, Nick. What is Tran doing here?\nOh, well, I picked my own name.\nSo you said to bring somebody. So I thought it'd be weird if I didn't bring someone. So I just brought Tran.\nYou brought an old Asian man to my sex party so it wouldn't be weird?\nRelax. He didn't come empty-handed.\nHe brought a game. It's like Thailand Monopoly.\nYeah, all the squares are jail except for one piece of property which we all have to fight each other for.\nBut don't get caught in the Red Light District.\nThis isn't a freaking game night, Nick.\nOkay, chill out.\n(knocking) You... You're making a mockery of this holiday and you know it.\nI didn't mean to make fun of Thailand, if that's where you're from even.\nHey.\nLucy.\nIt's so good to see you.\nHow are you?\nOh, I'm great.\nLucy? Lucy's here with Schmidt?\nWhere's my set-up, already? I'm looking at the menu, and I see a lot of skirt but no steak.\nI think that Coach picked you, so watch out.\n'Cause I'm sure he's gonna bring one of his clients or weird, like, gym buddies.\n(whispering): Ryan.\nWhat?\nRyan. Ryan.\nRyan-Ryan?\nHe brought Ryan. Oh, God.\nI don't think I can even look at him, like, without getting pregnant.\nHe just oozes sex.\nGood holiday to you! I've come with biscuits!\n(groaning)\nHey, hey, hey, Schmidt, Lucy?\nI-I used to date Lucy.\nOh, I know, bro.\nI met her that day you gave me the pass to your gym.\nHey, do you have any snacks?!\nYeah, you blew her off. I didn't think it would be a problem.\nOh, it's a problem. I'm telling you it's a problem.\nAnd I forbid you from dating her, so... (whistles) cut it off.\nGrounds?\nThe statute of limitation hasn't expired.\nYou dated her three years ago for, like, two and a half months.\nThe statute is very specific. 1,000 showers.\nAfter that, no claim. And if you think I've showered 1,000 times in the past three years, then you're out of your mind.\nDid you ever spend more than $65 on her, not including tip?\nIt's tough. There were a lot of coupons involved.\nDid you ever watch her dog?\nTrick question: she had fish and I killed them.\nYou ever get her a gift?\nEvery time we had sex.\n(laughs) No claim.\n(laughs) No claim?\nHi, Nick. It's been a long time.\nLucille. Great to see you.\nDo you still like to eat, uh... popcorn?\nI guess so.\nOh, you see that? I know her foods.\nYou must have spoiled her, huh?\nYou know, if you'll excuse us, I'm gonna give Lucy the tour.\nCome on, Lucy.\nI'm calling my penis \"the tour.\"\nMy tour's more satisfying.\nHis is all about him. Mine's about you sometimes.\nHi.\nHi. Uh, thanks for inviting me tonight.\nI-I didn't realize this was a singles party.\nOh. No. Uh, s-sorry.\nDid Coach say that with a Sean Connery accent?\nDid he say \"shingles\"? 'Cause he was...\nHe actually meant shingles. Like the... Like...\nThe... Everybody here is a roofer.\nLook, the last time I saw you, I kissed you.\nI know that. We both know that.\nBut this can't happen. Are we attracted to each other? Yes!\nDo I sing Oasis songs to myself, and pretend that they were inspired by your love for me? I do.\nBut my job is to enforce the rules.\nAnd I love my job, and I worked hard to get it. So this cannot happen.\nIs that why you locked me in your bedroom, and undone the top button of your dress?\nI didn't undo the top...\nWell, I did...\nBut that was an accident. That wasn't for you.\nIt was for me.\nI just need to know that you will respect the rules and that this will go no further.\nI'll do my best.\nLooks like you missed a few.\nWhat?\nOkay, I summoned everyone to the roof because Bangsgiving is in peril.\nAll of you are focusing on things that have nothing to do with getting laid.\nLet us please not repeat the mistakes that we made at my Eight Nights of Hump-akah party.\nNow, what is the freakin' problem?\nCoach did the opposite of what I asked.\nCome on, Jess, you guys would be great together.\nIt's a dumb rule, all right? Dumb rule.\nAt least he turns you on. Pepper makes my ding-dong and my ping-pongs go into my body.\nCan somebody help me with this keg?\nYeah, sure.\nPepper's got it.\n(grunts)\nWhat if she doesn't know her own strength down there, and she mushes it, or, Be a nightmare. like, rips it off and throws it across the room like a hot dog?\nThat's nothing. Jess brought me a hot lunch lady.\nWhat am I supposed to do with that?\nDo sex with the lunch lady.\nWait.\nThat's obvious. I have a real...\nI know how it sounds. I know how it sounds, but she's a... like, a real lunch lady.\nThat's hot.\nA woman that's willing, ready and able...\nNick: That's not an issue.\nAfter she has sex with you, she can put food in your mouth.\nThat's not a problem at all. I do have a real problem.\nSchmidt is trying to sleep with a woman I've already slept with.\nWell, at least he has a date, because mine never showed up.\nGeoff is coming! Apparently, a wild peacock got loose on the freeway, and is holding up traffic.\nNow, you guys, we have guests downstairs.\nAnd if we don't get back to them soon, they're gonna get spooked.\nUm, so, have you always been from England?\nI'm not going downstairs until Schmidt agrees to not sleep with Lucy.\nOkay, yeah, sure. Never!\nAccording to the statute, if you two can't agree, we take it to a vote.\nThe winner gets the girl, the loser gets five grilled cheese sandwiches.\nNick: I'll agree to that.\nLet's do it.\nAll right, all those in favor of Schmidt not sleeping with Lucy, raise your hand now.\nI don't care.\nCouldn't care less.\nRaise 'em up.\nPut 'em up.\nHuzzah! Warning: tonight things will get loud with Lucy.\nBut don't worry. I'll have her jam a sock in my mouth right before I see angels.\nOkay, guys, what about me?\nGet your own sock.\nNo. What am I gonna do about Ryan?\nJust have sex with him.\nLook, bang one out, get it out of your system.\nI don't do that.\nYou should do that.\nYou should bang one out.\nYeah, makes the most sense.\nWhat?!\nNothing else has worked, okay, and the best way to get over a crush is just to do something about it.\nI don't know.\nPlus, he's British, so you know the sex will be weirdly polite.\n(with British accent): Do you mind if I finish now?\nHe doesn't sound like Oliver Twist.\n(British accent): Do you like that? Is that good, eh?\nAll right. Here we go.\nOne... really? Two... what?\nDo you mind if I do it like that?\nHey, you like it when I do it like that, eh?\nThat was spot-on.\nAll those in favor of Jess doing Ryan, raise your hand.\n(talking quietly)\nOh, he's trying to mess with me?\nHere I go.\nCecilia.\nNo, you cannot have my beer.\n(laughs)\nNick: You think I'm going after the beer.\nYou okay?\nMm.\nOkay, great.\n(groans)\n(talks quietly)\n\n\n\n(phone buzzing)\n(gasps)\nHappy Bangsgiving.\n(whispers): Close the door.\nOh, my God.\nIs there nothing underneath that apron?\nJust a little white meat looking for some gravy.\nThat probably wasn't very sexy. I shouldn't have said that!\nNo, it was very becoming.\nI'm totally confused about these oven mitts.\nHow else am I supposed to take a hot dish out of the oven?\nThese mitts were a bad idea.\nWhat, uh, got you in the-the, uh, holiday, uh, sp-spirit?\nWell, I like you, you like me.\nWhy don't we just... bang one out of our system?\nBang one out of our system?\nIt sounds really bad. I get that.\nAnd I hear it now, it sounds awful.\nBut we just bang one out of our system, and then, we can go back to our strictly professional relationship, and I can stop thinking about you all the time, which I do.\nI didn't come here to bang one out.\nWell, you know what I mean.\nLook...\nI care about you.\nWell...\nJess, I'm crazy about you.\nRyan, look. Oh, God, it's so complicated.\nCan I just put some pants on when we talk about this?\nIt is complicated.\nThis would have been worth it.\nOh, God. Ryan. Ryan!\nOh, God!\nNick: Oh! Yeah!\n(hooting, whooping and overlapping chatter)\nOh, no!\nFreaking Bangsgiving.\nSchmidt: No, I actually put those in there myself.\nI'll tell you, I wouldn't eat asparagus though.\nIt makes your pee smell.\n(laughs) Mmm.\nHey, Cece, I got that $20 I owe you.\nIt's, uh... it's in my bedroom.\nOkay.\nYeah, it's right this way.\nYou're really sexy for a Jew.\nNot now, woman!\nWait. What?\nWho needs men? You don't need a man.\nYou can lift your own furniture.\nHey, Pepper.\nOh, God.\nOh, my God, are you okay?\nI am so sorry. You approached my blind spot.\nYour money is in her somewhere. Let me just find it.\nGreat.\nOh!\nWhat's the matter? Did you hurt yourself?\nNo, it's just not there. Let me... Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...\nOoh, ohh, that feels so good!\nWhen I'm looking for your money, it feels so good.\nI love that!\n(loudly) You nasty woman! (softly) Cause you are making me give the money to you.\nOh, Cece, you love this!\nGetting your money.\nWhat exactly are you doing right now?\nGetting your money.\nYou are definitely not getting my money, in no world you have my money.\nI was flirting with you to give Schmidt a taste of his own medicine, okay, and it's a huge mistake and insulting to everyone involved, and I'm sorry.\nYeah, and also he would never fall for that, at all, okay...\nYou are a dead man Miller!\nDon't, don't.\nI'll choke you to dead.\nI'll choke you to...\nBarely fighting. Schmidt, nothing was going on.\nHe was just trying to make you jealous.\nPlease, I know that!\nHe would never hit on you.\nYou are on my Never List.\nI know she...\nWhoa! Whoa! What are you doing?\nYou pissed me for bringing Lucy, and you bring Tran as a date?\nLeave Tran out of this, he fought in Korea.\nI don't know which side, but I know he is a war hero.\nYou couldn't find one of those drunk girls at the bar?\nThe ones with no family or friends. That's your sweet spot, man.\nI know, I could have. I didn't want to.\nWhy not?\nWhat kind of women have you been sleeping since you and Jess broke up?\nTerrible ones.\nAnd how does that make you feel?\nTerrible.\nThen reaaly good.\nExpected, expected.\nThere you go.\nAnd then immediately after terrible.\nJust gonna put this out there, but I think you'd probably rather like to sleep with someone who doesn't make you feel terrible, but, you're just a little afraid of getting hurt again.\nNah, it didn't sound right.\nYou know, growing up we had this lunch lady named Miss Wheaton.\nOne day, I cut in line, so I can get actual tater tots.\nAnd as punishment, she made me eat the entire tray.\nIn front of her.\nWhile she's stared at me, for a long period of time.\nAnd I'm not sure if you know how hard that is for a growing boy.\nHow old were you?\nI was 18.\n(chuckles)\nIf it helps, we're called lunch monitor now.\nNo one says lunch lady anymore.\n(chuckles) Kind of like how you can't call little people \"shrinkies\".\nOh, lunch monitor Pearl, I like you.\nExcellent form.\nYou don't have a hard job.\nSo, I saw your butt earlier. It's been holding up nicely.\nIt does the trick.\nAnd I noticed, uh, Ryan left.\nYeah. Ugh! It's so embarrassing.\nI kind of came onto him, and he told me he wanted more than just sex.\nHe wanted more than sex and that's a bad thing? How?\nWell, look, I'm his boss.\nWe could get sued, and I could get fired.\nThere's a reason it's against the rules.\nYou gotta br... okay.\nRemember when we tried to watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off?\nOkay, I stick by that... that kid is not a hero.\nAll he does is break rules. What's so great about that?\nYou're taking Rooney's side. No one takes Rooney's side.\nI'm a vice principal... Rooney is my people.\nFerris hijacks a parade.\nThat is an act of terror.\nYou want to know what I think, 'cause you're not going to like it.\nWhat?\nI don't think this is about breaking rules.\nI think Ryan scares you.\nYou like him, and you're going to have to put yourself out there again, and that scares you.\nBut look, life moves really fast.\nAnd if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you just might miss it.\nIs that from Ferris Bueller?\nYes, it is.\nOkay.\nIt's a terrific movie.\nAll right.\nAnd I delivered it perfectly.\nIt was pretty good.\nWhat are you doing here?\nYou're fired.\n(laughs) Just kidding.\nOh, God.\nYou left without eating so I thought, um...\nI'd bring you a pie. Well, most of a pie.\nThe guys ate some of it. That's a lie.\nI ate-I ate-I ate a piece on the way over.\nI-I ate two pieces.\nThree pieces.\nThank you.\nYou're welcome.\nWould you like to come inside?\nNo, um, I came here to say something and that this...\nI want more, too.\nThis dish is empty.\nOkay. I ate the whole pie.\nLook, I don't know what I'm doing or where this is going (sighs) and I'm scared, but... it's worth it 'cause it feels big.\nAnd that's why I'm going to leave right now, and we're going to take it slow.\nWow.\nWell, tonight is Bangsgiving, and I have to honor my American traditions.\nIt's my duty as an American...\nI think I'm going to stop being afraid and start dating.\nYou probably knew all along, didn't you?\nIf only I could meet a girl like you, Tran.\nYour face, your brain... throw it in a dress.\nOh, daddy, I'd be with her forever.\nI'm getting off topic.\nThanks for the talk. I feel a lot better.\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\nTran, are these all yours?\nCome on, man.\nI thought you were switching to white wine.\nHow do you think you're going to get home now?\nYou're not driving, so how are you going to get home?\n(knocking)\nHey.\nAre you Nick?\nYou the guy who's obsessed with my grandfather?\nGrandpaps, you ready to go?\nHey.\n(screams)\nAh, ah, ha... hey.\nI'm taking off. Um... sorry I body-slammed you but this doesn't feel like it's working out so I don't really want to waste our time.\nLook, Pepper, um...\nI think you're beautiful, and very nice.\nI just, uh...\nYou know, I'm not used to... dating women that are stronger than me.\nHow do you know that I'm stronger than you?\nDo you want to arm wrestle?\nYeah, like I'm that insecure that I have to prove my masculinity by arm wrestling a girl.\n(yells) Come on.\nReady?\nYeah.\nOne, two, three.\n(grunting)\n(yells)\nYes! That's how you do it!\nThat's how it's uh-uh-uh done!\n(moaning)\n(giggling)\nThank you for letting me win.\nSure. Anytime.\nWell, Lucy left.\nTurns out she's a bit of an anti-Semite.\nHmm.\nYeah, looks like we both struck out.\nOkay, Schmidt, there is no Geoff.\nCome on.

Oh!\nWe cool?\n(Exhales)\nYeah, we cool.\nCool.\nWhat the hell just happened?\nFight.\nYeah. Now it's over.\nI barely even remember it.\nI cannot believe you guys handle things that way.\nI'm starting to think that neither one of you read the Madeleine Albright biography I gave you for Christmas.\n(chuckles) I'm so glad we don't fight.\nI know.\nCoach: Oh, please. Women fight.\nWell, we occasionally get into a little thing.\nYeah, I mean, like we just had that thing with the purse... but that was, like, barely even a thing.\nYeah, that was nothing... I mean, there's no point in even talking about it.\nOh.\n(Gasps) Oh.\nOh. No, you should have that.\nNo, you should have it.\nNo, you take it.\nNo, you take it.\nNo, you take it.\nI want you to take it.\nNo. Take it.\nLook, I want you to have it\n'cause it would look good on you.\n- No, it's made for you.

Now you match.\nWell, congratulations on having sisters, but I know women. You blindfold me, spin me around and drop me into a rainstorm, and I'll still find the G-spot.\nSchmidt...\nLet us not forget that I had boobs for the first 19 years of my life.\nI grew up as a fat, asexual friend-zoner.\nYou can't buy that kind of access.\nSchmidt, I'm talking about how women act towards other women.\nYou don't want to get in the middle of that.\nCoach...\nJess has the purse. I saw it in her closet when it was rainy and I was bored and I was feeling snoopy.\nCoach: No, no, no...\nSee?\nLook... the purse.\nIn the immortal words of Tag Team, Whoop. There it is.\nFine. I went back and I bought the purse, 'cause I love it.\n(frustrated groan) I love purses.\nAnd that doesn't mean I'm not a feminist, either.\nI'm a damn feminist who loves purses.\nWhere else am I supposed to keep my feminist writings?\nIn a purse, that's where.\nLena Dunham.\nI don't know. I...\nJess, it's a purse. Who cares? Just apologize.\nCece and I have been friends for 20 years.\nDo you know why? Because we're passive-aggressive people.\nWe never confront anything.\nThat's the way it works with us. It always has.\nHi.\nHi.\nAnd that was one of the worst fights we've ever had.\nAnd if I bring up the purse, then everything else comes up with it.\nToo many things have happened.\nWomen have amazing memories.\nBecause we used to be the gatherers, and so we had to remember where all the best berries were hidden.\nAnd Cece and I, we've hidden berries all across the Great Plains.\nColorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska... need I say more?\nCoach gets it.\nSee, Cece and I, we're gonna be fine, 'cause it's gonna play out the way it always does.\nWe're not gonna talk for three days, and then I'll surprise her with a latte. And then we'll act like nothing happened.\nThree days without Cece?\nDo I have to spend three days without Cece?\nYes. I don't trust you around her.\nShe makes you weak and penis-dumb.\nThree days without Cece? Why don't you just replace my shoes with bags and turn me into a lunatic?\nStay out of it, man.\nStay the hell out of it, bro.\nHere's a different take: Why don't I spend more time with her?\nStay out of it.\nI'm confused.\nNow, should I... are you asking me to spend more time with her or stay out of it?\nLike, for real?\n(groans)\nI hate this. I hate first dates.\nMe, too. I hate all...\nI hate the second ones and the third ones and the fourth ones.\nMe, too. Yeah. Yeah.\nI hate dates.\nMm-hmm.\nYeah.\nThe first ones are the worst.\nYeah.\nThis is terrible.\nThey're terrible. They're awkward.\nI feel like I'm being weird.\nYou're not being weird.\nYeah, I am.\nI'm the weirdo.\nI wanted to do this all night.\nOh.\nThat is so stupid. (Laughs)\nI hated that I did it.\nI feel like I'm being weird, too.\nHow?\nI don't know how. Just...\nWell, now you are.\nThese sweaters. I got sweater shoulder.\nNow... when you do that, it's very weird.\nBut before, it wasn't.\nJust don't do sweater shoulder.\nPlease don't tell Tran how bad this is going.\nOh, I will.\nDon't. It'll be so embarrassing.\nYeah.\nHe's probably my best friend.\nReally?\nYes.\nYou're not his best friend.\n(laughing)\nThat's a terrible thing to say. (Laughing)\nIt's true.\nThis is going great.\nOh, God, I hate this.\nI just want to sit around and do nothing, but that is not hot.\nThat's hot to me.\nYou add some sweatpants to that, and that is better than p0rn.\n(chuckles) I love p0rn.\nBut I like to mute it and come up with my own voices, like, (deeply): Hey, that's a very interesting mesh cat suit.\n(high-pitched): Thank you. It used to be my grandmother's.\n(laughs) Something like that.\nCheers.\nYeah.\nThat was a weird cheers!\nCan we go?!\n(laughs): Yes. Let's get out of here. This sucks!\n(chewing, speaking unintelligibly)\nSo cute.\nYeah, it's like they're made for each other.\nThey haven't moved in three days.\nVery weird.\nAlarming, even.\nWait, doesn't she work or... ?\nShouldn't you be studying?\nOr live somewhere?\nShouldn't you be studying?\nOr have worried loved ones?\nStudying?\nCoach, this is gonna take some serious investigative police skills.\nBut I'm on to her.\nI didn't know girls could be so slovenly.\nI did. I have sisters.\nOh, my God, we know.\n(grunts)\nWe cool?\nWe cool.\nOh. Just who I was looking for.\nHey.\nHow would you like a piping hot latte?\nThanks, Jess, but, you know, I, um...\nI can buy my own.\nWhat did you do?\nIs this about the socks?\nYou weren't supposed to talk to Cece. What happened?\nWell, I had to see her.\nI can't go three days without seeing Cece.\n(exhales) And it went just like you said it would.\nI'm gonna go get the purse.\nShe played me like John Popper plays that little harmonica and fiddle thing.\nUgh. She's like a robot scientist.\nAnd you're like a damn robot.\nAnd usually it's cute, except when you're robbing me.\nJess, I'm sorry. So... what... what happens now?\nYou bring her another coffee and you guys make up?\nI don't know what happens now.\nWe're in unchartered territory 'cause you got involved.\nWe're entering the abyss.\nIt's like the month I decided not to wear a bra. Those were dark times.\nI had no support. Literally no support.\n(Phone dings)\n(scoffs) Cece just texted me a smiley face.\nIs that bad?\nNo, she just texted me the world's first good smiley face.\nI'm gonna text her... (chuckles) ... a yellow heart.\nNo, uh, yellow heart, whale, thumbs up.\n(Whoosh)\nWell, that seems nice.\n(Whoosh)\n(gasps)How dare she? Chinese man, ballerina, apartment building?\nWhat does that mean?\nFine. Poop. Turban guy. Granny.\n(whoosh, whoosh)\nDon't text her poop.\n(Gasps) Explosion, monkey-see? You want to play dirty? Fine.\nSlice of cake. Turtle.\n(Whoosh)\nDon't sen... Oh.\n(Whoosh) (gasps)\nDouble syringe?\nDouble syringe.\nYou're right, Schmidt.\nMaybe it's time to dig up some berries.\nThe gatherers have become the hunters.\nBe well.\nWh... where are you... where are going?\nL... leave those berries be.\n- Republican or Democrat?\nWest Wing.\nWhat's your favorite thing about America?\n- Kentucky women.\nFavorite part of The Rock?\nWelcome to the Rock.\nGorilla or monkey?\nGorilla, hands down.\nMiranda or Carrie?\nGorilla.\nThat's 100% perfect.\nUnb... unbelievable.\nThank you.\nThe battery in the remote control is getting a little jumpy. I'm gonna go grab one out of the smoke detector.\nThat's exactly where I get them.\nIsn't she perfect?\nIn a word: No.\nNick, you might want to sit down for this.\nI'm already sitting.\nOkay.\nWell, look... I put together a profile.\nVague about where she lives.\nOkay.\nNo mention of a job.\nAlways lets you pay.\nNick, my man, as unbelievable as this sounds... (chuckles) ... you're her sugar daddy.\nWhat kind of girl would want me as her sugar daddy?\nOnly one kind: a homeless woman.\nKai is not homeless.\nNick, I have been watching her for days now, okay?\nShe... she eats like she doesn't know where her next meal is coming from.\nShe always dresses in layers, tons of layers.\nShe's not homeless. Her grandfather is Tran.\nAnd where does he hang out?\nA park bench.\nI think you're having a nervous breakdown.\nI really do.\nYou're nuts. You want to avoid studying so much that you're making up lies about my new lover friend.\nJust leave us alone.\nMaybe you should... maybe you should give her our can opener. Everybody gives bums cans, but they can't open them cans.\nHow are they gonna open the cans, Nick?\nHey...\nWhat are you... (stammers)\nDo you want a blanket?\nI must have fallen asleep reading.\nNap with me.\nOkay.\nCome on.\n(Short chuckle)\nJust... gonna get some of these newspapers.\nIt's actually kind of nice.\nSee?\n\n(indistinct conversations)\nMore pink lemonade?\nI'm going to name baby...\nBaby, because it's funny. (Giggles)\n(soft chuckle)\nWhere is top of baby cage?\nDouble syringe?\nHey, you. How's pee-pee? (Giggles)\nOh, hello, Nadia.\nCoach, I need you. Jess and Cece are in a thing, and it is terrifying.\nI'm pretty busy, but, all right, hold on, let me put down the stuff I've been working on.\n(softly grunting)\nCoach, I am at the baby shower.\nYou're at the... what?\nAre you dumb? You're dumb.\nYou're very dumb. Get out of there.\nI panicked. I didn't know what else to do.\nI thought I could fix this. I gave Cece the purse.\nObviously, it was a mistake.\nOh, God, look at them.\nThey're like silent, angry statues right now... it's terrifying and als...\nMaybe a little erotic.\nOkay, fine, it's very erotic.\nYou know what? Coach, I'm telling you...\nI'm finding out that fear plays a big part in my sexuality.\nSchmidt, what happens when two passive-aggressive people start confronting each other?\nI don't know. What happens?\nAnything!\nAnything can happen. That's what I'm telling you.\nAre you ready for anything to happen?\nObviously not. That's why I'm calling you.\nDid you wash your hair? It looks really clean.\n(all quietly gasp)\n(Jess gasps)\nI can help you end this.\nDo you know why?\nDo you know why? I'm waiting.\nOh, my God, is it because you have sisters?\nIt's because\nI have sisters! And you know what that means?\nAnd that you know more about women than me.\nI know more about women than you.\nAnd that I'm a little dum-dum.\nAnd I'm a big smart-smart.\nYeah. Now, here's what you're gonna do.\nGet big like a bear.\nIf that doesn't work, pee a circle around yourself and light it on fire.\nI peed before I came... I had a root beer with lunch.\nI'm on my way. Hey, uh, did you bring a gift?\n'Cause I don't want to be that guy.\nYou know, the guy that doesn't bring a gift?\nJust get over here.\nAll right, I'm coming.\nWhat? Coach.\nCoach, I can't turn the pages.\nHow am I gonna study if I can't turn the pages?\nCoach!\nHey.\n(gagging)\nGreat catch.\nKai, I want to go to your place, okay?\nWherever it is.\nSo don't be afraid, because I'm not afraid.\nI know I'm living this rock star life, but I'm still a man of the people.\nBut I'm so comfortable. You really want to go outside, get off this bed into the cold right now?\nLook, I like you for you, and...\nWell, hell, I just hope, deep down, you like me for me and not all the incredible stuff that I have.\nHuh?\nI mean, this room... half this stuff is mine.\nI'm, like, I have enough pillowcases for all my pillows, plus an extra pillowcase that I don't even use.\nTicket stubs to all the Bears games I've ever been to, except for one.\nThe guitar pic from that guy who played with James Taylor that one night.\nA Frisbee that I'm currently storing on my neighbor's roof.\nYou know, an autographed\nKarate Kid II poster from Mr. Miyagi.\nR.I.P.\nHmm.\nBut none of that matters.\nI want to be with you wherever you live.\nI mean, hell, I've been cooped up in this palace for long enough.\nWow. Well, if it's that important.\n(grunts)\n(laughs)\nAll right. Don't be nervous.\nYou know what? I'm gonna bring some extra blankets.\nOkay.\nOkay, just in case it's freezing, 'cause it's outs...\nOkay.\nJess: And then, you told Mike Hannamin I was on my period!\nHe wanted to know why you were wearing sweatpants in the pool!\nOkay, I was defending you!\nI have arrived!\nAh, Mr. Stripper.\nOkay, so what's next, Jess?\n20 years of fights are happening right now.\nThey're getting into everything.\nHow I intentionally didn't put gas in your car on senior ditch day?\nYou did. You did.\nI did not!\nAll right, ladies, stop it.\nI gave you the money, and you spent it on condoms and taffy.\nBy the way, that sounds like a hell of a day.\nWell, I wouldn't know. I was stranded on a beach being a virgin!\nBut that's not the only time I've been stranded, now, is it?\nI'm talking about Paris.\nOh, this is about Paris!\nI'm talking about Paris.\nI knew it!\nWe had signed a lease. That's an agreement.\nAnd then you decide to take a modeling job in Paris, so I had to move in with Spencer?\nWhile you were being squired about the Louvre, I was having to pee on top of Spencer's pee to conserve water!\nYou know, it's called mud-sharking, by the way.\nIt's not my fault!\nStop it!\nI'm bored.\nHere's what you guys are gonna do.\nYou're gonna punch each other.\nNow I'm not bored.\nI'm not doing that.\nWhat?\nI'm not doing that.\nCoach: Well, you got to do something.\nMan up, punch each other and end this.\n(sighs, sniffles)\nCoach: You gotta have it out so you can get past this.\nNow I'm bored again.\nPunch each other!\nNow I'm not bored.\nTalk with your fist!\n(sighs) I just want my...\n(screaming, overlapping shouting and chatter)\nOh, no!\nMy goodness!\nBack off!\n(grunting)\nLa... ladies?\nOh!\nSchmidt: It's spreading.\nStop it!\nRussian baby shower.\n(overlapping chatter, groaning)\n(groaning, indistinct chatter)\nHey, hey, don't involve us, please.\nWhoa.

I think I wanted to punch you for a really long time.\nFelt that way. Like maybe ten or 15 years.\nAnd it feels so good that right now we don't have to talk everything through.\nYeah. We can just punch it out.\nOh, my God, I have missed you.\n(both laughing)\nI can't believe I've known you 20 years.\nAnd you're still my favorite person to talk to.\nAnd you're my favorite person to talk to.\nI hate not talking to you.\nI feel like I've missed everything!\nYou did miss everything.\nSo, does Nick have a girlfriend?\nYes. So weird.\nYou okay?\nYes. So weird.\n(Laughing)\nSo, is Nadia going to raise the baby in your apartment?\nYeah, we haven't really talked about that yet.\nYou should.\n(laughing)\nCraig Hodges.\nOh!\n(Phone ringing)\nHello.

I was right!\nYou were wrong about literally everything.\nBut I knew there was gonna be a twist, though.\nOkay, do you realize how much time you've wasted, and you're not studying?\nSweet Baby LeBron James, I screwed up.\n(groans)\nHey, I should probably get going.\nI got to get to work.\nYeah, it's karaoke night, so I got to get there early enough to break the karaoke machine.\nHow much will you make tonight?\nAh, it depends how much I drink, but probably about 140 bucks.\nWhat is this?\nI raise you to $200.\nNow you can stay.\nDeal.\nOh. (Laughs)\nI'm like a boy hooker.\n(both laugh)\nThank you.\nAre you crying?\nDon't look at me.\nI want to look pretty. You paid for it.\n(both laugh)\nNadia is the one who broke my thing.\nWait, you were serious about that?\nYes. That was her. I'm telling you.\nShe's going to have to childproof the corners of her cha-cha before that baby comes out.\nOh, Cecilia.\nThank goodness. Look at you. You're still pretty.\nAnd, Jess, you know, you... you look the same.\nCoach: I'm sorry about making you guys punch each other.\nDon't be sorry.\nYou're so right.\nMm.\nWe've wasted so much time being passive-aggressive.\nWe learned our lesson.\nYeah.\nWell, we're very smart.\nThat means a lot. Thank you.\nSeriously, if you guys fought like girls, you'd still be arguing over the fact\nthat you recorded football over your Charlie Rose episodes.\nIt's all good, man. Yeah, well, it's nothing.\nMm-hmm, and the girl Schmidt would be like, Oh, does Coach just think I'm a pretentious poseur who just records things to look smart because deep down, I am just terrifyingly insecure about my intelligence?\nJess: Yeah, and girl Coach would be, like, Does Schmidt think that I'm an uncultured meathead who has to rewatch football because I'm afraid of showing anyone my softer side?\n(clears throat quietly)\n(Cece and Jess laugh)\nHey, man.\nOh, hey, Coach.\nAw, hey, you.\nThat's nice.\nOh, this?\nI... I don't know. Thanks, I guess.\nI'm kind of whatever about it.\nNo.\nWhat do you got there?\nOh, me? Uh, just some sneakers.\n(laughs) I hope they're okay.\nI don't have an eye for things like you.\nWell, yeah, you do.

It's snowing there.\nYou gonna bite me?\nWhen we get on the plane, I'm gonna bite you back.\nBreast-feeding is a... very sensitive subject for me.\nI can help who's next.

Here, scoot down, scoot down.\nNick, what are you doing?\nWhat are you doing?\nSorry, just scoot down, I need to iron this shirt that I'm wearing for my date with Tran's granddaughter.\nIt's either this or the turtleneck my mother bought me in 2009.\nThey're my only clean shirts.\nThe short-sleeved turtleneck? Don't do that.\nOkay, look, we need this whole table for Nadia's baby shower, all right? So, move along.\nNadia, isn't that the Russian chick who broke, uh, Schmidt's, uh...\nSchmidt: Will to live?\nAfter she broke my penis?\n(chuckles)\nWho saw her and thought, That's the woman I want to be the mother of my children?\nShe's not sure.\nYeah, she calls it her little sex party miracle.\nDo you have to iron here?\nIt's the only flat surface!\nBesides Winston's desk... but he's using it to study for his police academy test, and he is not to be disturbed.\n \nNot enough, not enough.\nThere's an ironing board in the bathroom.\nI know, but I've been using that to wedge it between two urinals to keep Schmidt from peeking.\nBut fine, I'll use that!\nSchmidt: Coach!

Now it's over.\nI barely even remember it.\nI cannot believe you guys handle things that way.\nI'm starting to think that neither one of you read the Madeleine Albright biography I gave you for Christmas.\n(chuckles) I'm so glad we don't fight.\nI know.\nCoach: Oh, please. Women fight.\nWell, we occasionally get into a little thing.\nYeah, I mean, like we just had that thing with the purse... but that was, like, barely even a thing.\nYeah, that was nothing... I mean, there's no point in even talking about it.\nOh.\n(Gasps) Oh.\nOh. No, you should have that.\nNo, you should have it.\nNo, you take it.\nNo, you take it.\nNo, you take it.\nI want you to take it.\nNo. Take it.\nLook, I want you to have it\n'cause it would look good on you.\n- No, it's made for you.

Because we're passive-aggressive people.\nWe never confront anything.\nThat's the way it works with us. It always has.\nHi.\nHi.\nAnd that was one of the worst fights we've ever had.\nAnd if I bring up the purse, then everything else comes up with it.\nToo many things have happened.\nWomen have amazing memories.\nBecause we used to be the gatherers, and so we had to remember where all the best berries were hidden.\nAnd Cece and I, we've hidden berries all across the Great Plains.\nColorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska... need I say more?\nCoach gets it.\nSee, Cece and I, we're gonna be fine, 'cause it's gonna play out the way it always does.\nWe're not gonna talk for three days, and then I'll surprise her with a latte.

I don't trust you around her.\nShe makes you weak and penis-dumb.\nThree days without Cece? Why don't you just replace my shoes with bags and turn me into a lunatic?\nStay out of it, man.\nStay the hell out of it, bro.\nHere's a different take: Why don't I spend more time with her?\nStay out of it.\nI'm confused.\nNow, should I... are you asking me to spend more time with her or stay out of it?\nLike, for real?\n(groans)\nI hate this. I hate first dates.\nMe, too. I hate all...\nI hate the second ones and the third ones and the fourth ones.\nMe, too. Yeah. Yeah.\nI hate dates.\nMm-hmm.\nYeah.\nThe first ones are the worst.\nYeah.\nThis is terrible.\nThey're terrible. They're awkward.\nI feel like I'm being weird.\nYou're not being weird.\nYeah, I am.\nI'm the weirdo.\nI wanted to do this all night.\nOh.\nThat is so stupid. (Laughs)\nI hated that I did it.\nI feel like I'm being weird, too.\nHow?\nI don't know how. Just...\nWell, now you are.\nThese sweaters. I got sweater shoulder.\nNow... when you do that, it's very weird.\nBut before, it wasn't.\nJust don't do sweater shoulder.\nPlease don't tell Tran how bad this is going.\nOh, I will.\nDon't. It'll be so embarrassing.\nYeah.\nHe's probably my best friend.\nReally?\nYes.\nYou're not his best friend.\n(laughing)\nThat's a terrible thing to say. (Laughing)\nIt's true.\nThis is going great.\nOh, God, I hate this.\nI just want to sit around and do nothing, but that is not hot.\nThat's hot to me.\nYou add some sweatpants to that, and that is better than p0rn.\n(chuckles) I love p0rn.\nBut I like to mute it and come up with my own voices, like, (deeply): Hey, that's a very interesting mesh cat suit.\n(high-pitched): Thank you. It used to be my grandmother's.\n(laughs) Something like that.\nCheers.\nYeah.\nThat was a weird cheers!\nCan we go?!\n(laughs): Yes. Let's get out of here. This sucks!\n(chewing, speaking unintelligibly)\nSo cute.\nYeah, it's like they're made for each other.\nThey haven't moved in three days.\nVery weird.\nAlarming, even.\nWait, doesn't she work or... ?\nShouldn't you be studying?\nOr live somewhere?\nShouldn't you be studying?\nOr have worried loved ones?\nStudying?\nCoach, this is gonna take some serious investigative police skills.\nBut I'm on to her.\nI didn't know girls could be so slovenly.\nI did. I have sisters.\nOh, my God, we know.\n(grunts)\nWe cool?\nWe cool.\nOh. Just who I was looking for.\nHey.\nHow would you like a piping hot latte?\nThanks, Jess, but, you know, I, um...\nI can buy my own.\nWhat did you do?\nIs this about the socks?\nYou weren't supposed to talk to Cece. What happened?\nWell, I had to see her.\nI can't go three days without seeing Cece.\n(exhales) And it went just like you said it would.\nI'm gonna go get the purse.\nShe played me like John Popper plays that little harmonica and fiddle thing.\nUgh. She's like a robot scientist.\nAnd you're like a damn robot.\nAnd usually it's cute, except when you're robbing me.\nJess, I'm sorry. So... what... what happens now?\nYou bring her another coffee and you guys make up?\nI don't know what happens now.\nWe're in unchartered territory 'cause you got involved.\nWe're entering the abyss.\nIt's like the month I decided not to wear a bra. Those were dark times.\nI had no support. Literally no support.\n(Phone dings)\n(scoffs) Cece just texted me a smiley face.\nIs that bad?\nNo, she just texted me the world's first good smiley face.\nI'm gonna text her... (chuckles) ... a yellow heart.\nNo, uh, yellow heart, whale, thumbs up.\n(Whoosh)\nWell, that seems nice.\n(Whoosh)\n(gasps)How dare she?

I'm gonna go grab one out of the smoke detector.\nThat's exactly where I get them.\nIsn't she perfect?\nIn a word: No.\nNick, you might want to sit down for this.\nI'm already sitting.\nOkay.\nWell, look... I put together a profile.\nVague about where she lives.\nOkay.\nNo mention of a job.\nAlways lets you pay.\nNick, my man, as unbelievable as this sounds... (chuckles) ... you're her sugar daddy.\nWhat kind of girl would want me as her sugar daddy?\nOnly one kind: a homeless woman.\nKai is not homeless.\nNick, I have been watching her for days now, okay?\nShe... she eats like she doesn't know where her next meal is coming from.\nShe always dresses in layers, tons of layers.\nShe's not homeless. Her grandfather is Tran.\nAnd where does he hang out?\nA park bench.\nI think you're having a nervous breakdown.\nI really do.\nYou're nuts. You want to avoid studying so much that you're making up lies about my new lover friend.\nJust leave us alone.\nMaybe you should... maybe you should give her our can opener. Everybody gives bums cans, but they can't open them cans.\nHow are they gonna open the cans, Nick?\nHey...\nWhat are you... (stammers)\nDo you want a blanket?\nI must have fallen asleep reading.\nNap with me.\nOkay.\nCome on.\n(Short chuckle)\nJust... gonna get some of these newspapers.\nIt's actually kind of nice.\nSee?\n(indistinct conversations)\nMore pink lemonade?\nI'm going to name baby...\nBaby, because it's funny. (Giggles)\n(soft chuckle)\nWhere is top of baby cage?\nDouble syringe?\nHey, you. How's pee-pee? (Giggles)\nOh, hello, Nadia.\nCoach, I need you. Jess and Cece are in a thing, and it is terrifying.\nI'm pretty busy, but, all right, hold on, let me put down the stuff I've been working on.\n(softly grunting)\nCoach, I am at the baby shower.\nYou're at the... what?\nAre you dumb? You're dumb.\nYou're very dumb. Get out of there.\nI panicked. I didn't know what else to do.\nI thought I could fix this. I gave Cece the purse.\nObviously, it was a mistake.\nOh, God, look at them.\nThey're like silent, angry statues right now... it's terrifying and als...\nMaybe a little erotic.\nOkay, fine, it's very erotic.\nYou know what? Coach, I'm telling you...\nI'm finding out that fear plays a big part in my sexuality.\nSchmidt, what happens when two passive-aggressive people start confronting each other?\nI don't know. What happens?\nAnything!\nAnything can happen. That's what I'm telling you.\nAre you ready for anything to happen?\nObviously not. That's why I'm calling you.\nDid you wash your hair? It looks really clean.\n(all quietly gasp)\n(Jess gasps)\nI can help you end this.\nDo you know why?\nDo you know why? I'm waiting.\nOh, my God, is it because you have sisters?\nIt's because\nI have sisters! And you know what that means?\nAnd that you know more about women than me.\nI know more about women than you.\nAnd that I'm a little dum-dum.\nAnd I'm a big smart-smart.\nYeah. Now, here's what you're gonna do.\nGet big like a bear.\nIf that doesn't work, pee a circle around yourself and light it on fire.\nI peed before I came... I had a root beer with lunch.\nI'm on my way. Hey, uh, did you bring a gift?\n'Cause I don't want to be that guy.\nYou know, the guy that doesn't bring a gift?\nJust get over here.\nAll right, I'm coming.\nWhat?

You really want to go outside, get off this bed into the cold right now?\nLook, I like you for you, and...\nWell, hell, I just hope, deep down, you like me for me and not all the incredible stuff that I have.\nHuh?\nI mean, this room... half this stuff is mine.\nI'm, like, I have enough pillowcases for all my pillows, plus an extra pillowcase that I don't even use.\nTicket stubs to all the Bears games I've ever been to, except for one.\nThe guitar pic from that guy who played with James Taylor that one night.\nA Frisbee that I'm currently storing on my neighbor's roof.\nYou know, an autographed\nKarate Kid II poster from Mr. Miyagi.\nR.I.P.\nHmm.\nBut none of that matters.\nI want to be with you wherever you live.\nI mean, hell, I've been cooped up in this palace for long enough.\nWow.

You did.\nI did not!\nAll right, ladies, stop it.\nI gave you the money, and you spent it on condoms and taffy.\nBy the way, that sounds like a hell of a day.\nWell, I wouldn't know. I was stranded on a beach being a virgin!\nBut that's not the only time I've been stranded, now, is it?\nI'm talking about Paris.\nOh, this is about Paris!\nI'm talking about Paris.\nI knew it!\nWe had signed a lease. That's an agreement.\nAnd then you decide to take a modeling job in Paris, so I had to move in with Spencer?\nWhile you were being squired about the Louvre, I was having to pee on top of Spencer's pee to conserve water!\nYou know, it's called mud-sharking, by the way.\nIt's not my fault!\nStop it!\nI'm bored.\nHere's what you guys are gonna do.\nYou're gonna punch each other.\nNow I'm not bored.\nI'm not doing that.\nWhat?\nI'm not doing that.\nCoach: Well, you got to do something.\nMan up, punch each other and end this.\n(sighs, sniffles)\nCoach: You gotta have it out so you can get past this.\nNow I'm bored again.\nPunch each other!\nNow I'm not bored.\nTalk with your fist!\n(sighs) I just want my...\n(screaming, overlapping shouting and chatter)\nOh, no!\nMy goodness!\nBack off!\n(grunting)\nLa... ladies?\nOh!\nSchmidt: It's spreading.\nStop it!\nRussian baby shower.\n(overlapping chatter, groaning)\n(groaning, indistinct chatter)\nHey, hey, don't involve us, please.\nWhoa.

Baby like.\nYay!\nDo I look pretty?\n(both laughing)\nDo you feel, like, really good right now?\nYes! I thought I was crazy.\nNo, you're not crazy.\nI think I... I think I wanted to punch you for a really long time.\nFelt that way. Like maybe ten or 15 years.\nAnd it feels so good that right now we don't have to talk everything through.\nYeah. We can just punch it out.\nOh, my God, I have missed you.\n(both laughing)\nI can't believe I've known you 20 years.\nAnd you're still my favorite person to talk to.\nAnd you're my favorite person to talk to.\nI hate not talking to you.\nI feel like I've missed everything!\nYou did miss everything.\nSo, does Nick have a girlfriend?\nYes.

Nick, are you okay?\nNick: Winston?\nListen, listen, listen, Nick.\nWinston.\nTell me everything.\nWinston, she's rich!\nYeah, she founded some company that sells fancy water bottles to rich people to pay for digging wells in Africa.\nShe sold the company, so now she works whenever she wants.\nIt's a scam called consulting.\nYou see, I knew it.\nI knew there was something weird. I was right!\nYou were wrong about literally everything.\nBut I knew there was gonna be a twist, though.\nOkay, do you realize how much time you've wasted, and you're not studying?\nSweet Baby LeBron James, I screwed up.\n(groans)\nHey, I should probably get going.\nI got to get to work.\nYeah, it's karaoke night, so I got to get there early enough to break the karaoke machine.\nHow much will you make tonight?\nAh, it depends how much I drink, but probably about 140 bucks.\nWhat is this?\nI raise you to $200.\nNow you can stay.\nDeal.\nOh. (Laughs)\nI'm like a boy hooker.\n(both laugh)\nThank you.\nAre you crying?\nDon't look at me.\nI want to look pretty. You paid for it.\n(both laugh)\nNadia is the one who broke my thing.\nWait, you were serious about that?\nYes. That was her. I'm telling you.\nShe's going to have to childproof the corners of her cha-cha before that baby comes out.\nOh, Cecilia.\nThank goodness. Look at you. You're still pretty.\nAnd, Jess, you know, you... you look the same.\nCoach: I'm sorry about making you guys punch each other.\nDon't be sorry.\nYou're so right.\nMm.\nWe've wasted so much time being passive-aggressive.\nWe learned our lesson.\nYeah.\nWell, we're very smart.\nThat means a lot. Thank you.\nSeriously, if you guys fought like girls, you'd still be arguing over the fact\nthat you recorded football over your Charlie Rose episodes.\nIt's all good, man. Yeah, well, it's nothing.\nMm-hmm, and the girl Schmidt would be like, Oh, does Coach just think I'm a pretentious poseur who just records things to look smart because deep down, I am just terrifyingly insecure about my intelligence?\nJess: Yeah, and girl Coach would be, like, Does Schmidt think that I'm an uncultured meathead who has to rewatch football because I'm afraid of showing anyone my softer side?\n(clears throat quietly)\n(Cece and Jess laugh)\nHey, man.\nOh, hey, Coach.\nAw, hey, you.\nThat's nice.\nOh, this?\nI... I don't know. Thanks, I guess.\nI'm kind of whatever about it.\nNo.\nWhat do you got there?\nOh, me? Uh, just some sneakers.\n(laughs) I hope they're okay.\nI don't have an eye for things like you.\nWell, yeah, you do. Come on, don't be so hard on yourself.\nYour eye is so good.\nI'm sure they're great.\nI...\nNot that you could look bad in anything really.\n(laughs)\n(groans)\n(groans) Son of a...\n(groans) Thank you for that.\nYeah, thanks, man.\nAnytime.\nWe cool?\nYeah, we cool.\n(whistles)\nOoh, boy.\nHow many pages are in this thing?\nDarius Miles.

Should I call my ma and blame her for passing on her wide flat ass?\n(imitates dialing phone)\nHello, Ma?\nI'm not calling about that.\nJust listen.\nI said... just listen.\nIt's about my butt.\nShould I continue?\nI'm gonna say no.\nYou won't frickin' get away with this.\nEat glass and die, you tramp!\nMrs. Raws!\nUh, you're not going to work.\nWhat are you talking...?\nYou're not going to work.\nYes, I'm going to work!\nSit down! Sit down!\nOf course I'm going to work.\nGina needs me.\nBesides, I like my stomach like I like my suits... no lining.\nHere, take your bottoms off, put these sweatpants on.\nYou take your bottoms off, sir!\nWhy don't you take your slacks off, so I can put some sweatpants on? Now take your bottoms off.\nI'm not gonna sit around here all day like an off-duty ice cream truck driver!\nI confiscated three laptops, two tablets and an e-reader.\nOh, and this satellite phone with a condom taped to it.\nMy earthquake kit?\nHey, look... for starters, Schmidt, you're sitting up way too straight.\nI feel like I'm sitting just fine.\nTake a deep breath...\nInhale it all the way in...\nNow...\n(whispering): let it go.\n(exhales)\nNow let go.\n(exhales)\nNow let go...\nI... I am letting go.\nYou're like a clenched fist, my man. Open up.\nYou're in a 1920s boxing stance.\nThis is a waste of time!\nYou're not going to work!\nI have a hyperactive nephew!\nWe have to swaddle him!\nSwaddle nothing!

Get him!\nGotta get to work!\nShh.\nShh...\nShh... you relaxed?\nYeah.\nOkay, ready?\nYou're gonna lay down.\nAll right, just for a minute.\n Good night, Schmidty. \n(sighs)\n(whispering): Now do me.\nOkay.\n(whispering indistinctly)\nHey, what's up, girl?\nHey, uh... remember when we used to do it and it was dope?\nNah.\nNah? What you talk...?\nYou still like Ryan?\nWell...\nIt's just the accent. That's the only thing that you...\nYou like the accent. I can do an accent.\n(bad Cockney accent): Ah can do an accent.\nYou like when I do this accent, eh?\nYou like when I do the accent?\nNot at all.\n(bad accent): My dad makes cheese...\nHe just made me realize that I want guys who have, like, frickin' feelings and stuff.\nYeah, well...\nBut the boy looks like he was raised in a muffin.\nOh. Hey.\nI've been holding office hours all year and this is the first time anyone's taken me up on it.\nRyan took you up on it, didn't he?\n(teachers gasp, laugh)\nThis is gonna be fine and, um, I'm going to address all of your problems one by one.\nIt just ain't right.\nOkay.\n\"Ain't... right.\"\nAnything else?\nIt's not okay.\n\"Not... okay.\"\nWhat else?\nI'm not all right with it.\nAnd when you lent me that sweater last week, was I supposed to, like...\nRuth!\nIt's unscrupulous, Ms. Day.\nIf you two are coming out, we are, too.\nMeet my boyfriend.\nSo you like teachers?\nI'd do whatever it takes to get my foliage trip off the ground.\nAnd now I know how things work around here.\nAnd you're not even my type, just so you know.\n Ba-da-da \nDon't do that.\nI'd be way more into this if you had, like, a classic Latin build.\nOkay, stop. Stop!\n'Cause I'm a ginger?\nJust get out.\n(teachers murmuring)\nMs. Day!\n(clamoring)\nOkay!\nI changed my mind.\nWe're gonna look at foliage.\nNow, will that make you people go back to your jobs?\nYeah.\n(murmuring agreement)\nI won something.\nI won something.\n\n\n\nHey.\nWhat's going on?\nEverybody was just so mad at me. I feel terrible. This is my fault.\nJess, maybe I should look for another job.\nNo! No! Absolutely not.\nNo, look, I have everything under control.\nI am 100% confident that I'm making the right decision.\nWinston: You got girl troubles, get a crystal.\nLook, I'm telling you, Coach, women have been checking me out all day.\nFrom the gentleman across the bar.\nThis is my favorite drink.\nHow did he...?\nSomething powerful told me it was.\nNow, they gave me this crystal to help me on the streets, but I'm starting to think it's gonna help me in the sheets.\nWinston, look at me. Mm-hmm.\nAnd I have never been more serious about anything in my life.\nOkay.\nStop rhyming.\nAll the timing?\nI don't need a crystal, I just need to be more frickin' sensitive, so stop trying to give me your crystal!\nOkay. I'm not supposed to be yelling.\nThat's what I'm...\nI need to be working... I need to work on that.\nI'm telling you, man, this crystal gives you the courage to do the one thing that you're scared of the most.\nTo me, it's country music line dancing.\nWell, that is terrifying.\nDon't do that.\nYou guys seen Schmidt?\nWhat the hell?\nMy word processor?\nYou can't Kathy Bates me forever!\nMy work needs me. Gina needs me.\nI'm sorry, but she's trying to kill you and I'm trying everything in my power to stop her.\nNo, you're trying to turn me into you.\nAren't you bored, Nick?\nI've been doing nothing for exactly one day and I already feel pathetic.\nThe Nick that I met in college would not be happy living like this.\nYou've changed.\nThat's not true. I've always been lazy.\nPhysically, yes. But mentally, you used to be like a da Vinci in tie-dye.\n \n(clears throat)\nWell, I'll be.\nThink differently.\nThe beer teat!\nAwesome, bro.\nHa!\nParty!\nWell, you changed, too.\nYou used to live by your own rules.\nYou were like a fat, Jewish Dennis Rodman.\nBut look at you now.\nYou're like the back of a horse in a two-person horse costume with Gina just farting in your face all day long.\nThat actually happened.\nWhat?!\nSchmidt, tell me, what do you get for all your hard work?\nThe sponge account.\nOh, great!\nGod willing, it'll get me red potatoes, too.\nSexiest starch since jasmine rice.\nGreat.\nI hope your work keeps making you walk around with your guts in a rusty old wagon.\n(computer begins playing '80s techno song)\nOh, hey, Nick.

Oh, hey, Coach.\nYou're dressed like Ryan.\nWhat?\n(laughs)\nNo, you see, I-I... I've had these clothes for forever, I just don't wear them when you're around.\nYou are dressed like Ryan!\nAre you around me all the time? No.\nDressing up like someone else isn't going to work.\nUnlike this crystal...\nShut up.\nAnd I am never taking this crystal off.\nWell, I mean, except if I'm making a tomato sauce and the crystal keeps dipping in the tomato sauce.\nThen I'll take it off, and that's just being practical.\nI don't know too much about crystal care, but, oh, I intend to find out.\nJess: See?\nI made the right decision.\nKids need to be in nature.\nEmily Kopnik saw a butterfly and she said, \"Oh, my God, country lice can fly.\"\nOh, cool.\nWell, I'm sensitive and I care about things like that.\nDo you like leaves, Eddie?\nNo.\nMe, too, buddy. Me, too.\nSo rake 'em into a observational mound... or \"a pile\"... and then we transfer the piles into one of these special research bags which you kids can take home.\nHey.\nWhat's happening here?\nHere's another rake.\nYou're not just having the kids, uh, rake the leaves and put them in a bag, are you?\nWhat now?\nI mean, do, uh... what else do you have planned?\nOh, don't worry about it.\nI'm a... biology professional.\nSo, how's that phantom ulcer treating you?\nI sent you those Q4 reports...\nHorrible burning!\nWell, I'm glad you're back.\nSee?

I always have.\nThen your only option is to go in and be yourself.\nJust got to own it.\nI think I'm a little scared.\nWell, that's very interesting. You see...\nHave you been here this whole time?\nThe entire time.\nThat is why God... made crystals.\nWhy did he make that shirt?\nHey.\nHey, look, Nick, I got to talk to you.\nI got to talk to you.\nYou go first.\nYou go first.\nOkay, you know what? You were right, Nick.\nI am a corporate monkey.\nI don't want to be an old man looking back on a meager life of... selling red potatoes for the man.\nI don't want to be a lazy bum my whole life.\nI want to be the kind of bum that other bums look at and say, \"What's that bum smiling about?\"\nI get that.\nI just had an idea, Schmidt.\nI just had an idea, too, but I feel like it's stupid.\nI feel like mine's stupid. Let's do it.\nI'm gonna... I'm just gonna...\nI'm gonna go to the kitchen.\nBut I want to hear what you have to say.\nIt's important to me... 'Cause maybe it's the same thing, maybe it's different.\nIt might be the same thing, so maybe we should just say it.\nYou want to do the classic on 11?\nYeah, okay, great.\nBoth: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11...\nLet's work together again!\nLet's work together again!\nYes!

Um, and you can come to me with any problems or anything you want to ask me, but I'm gonna make some decisions that you don't like, and you're just gonna have to deal with it.\nSo, uh, let's get back to work, okay?\nSo, is that the end of the meeting, then?\nYep.

It's the least that I could do.\nWell, I had no idea Schmidt had a cranky dank.\nSo, yeah, I'll let him be the boss.\n(whispering): I'm amazing.\nWhat?\nI'm amazing.\nWhat?\nWhat? Huh?\nWhat? Hmm?\nHmm, this is a bit of an unprecedented group, the three of us.\nThis isn't a social call, young lady.\nOh.\nThis is strictly business.\nHere's the deal.\nYou need money for college.\nNo. No, okay?\nI am not a charity case.\nThis isn't charity.\nNo. No, we've gone through this.\nThis is an investment.\nNick and Schmidt are looking for investors, so we thought it would be fun if we got into investing, too.\nYou're smart, you're driven.\nWe are confident in a very robust ROI.\nROI means \"Return On Investment.\"\nI know what it stands for.\nI've been reading a lot of Schmidt's investment books in the toilet.\nLife hack: the toilet paper makes for a very, very handy bookmark.\nLife hack: read your phone on the toilet like everybody else.\nOoh.\nThe answer is gonna be no, all right?\nBecause when you borrow money from friends, things get weird...\nN-N-No, do not mistake this for friendship, young lady, all right?\nAs far as I'm concerned, you're just a walking treasury bond.\nWithin three years of graduation, you will pay us back in full, plus ten percent of the principal.\nI really don't want to do this. At all.\nBut...\nThere's always a \"but,\" huh?\nBut I don't really have any other choice.\nYes!\nYou were right, man.\nSo I guess we're in business, boys.\nYes.\nWe wrote the check out to Cece.\nWe do not know your full name.\nThis is looking really good.\nIt's absolutely stunning.\nThis is... this is your vision from start to finish.\nI might be the seed, but you're the farmer.\nHey, you two look like you're really getting along.\nYeah, well, you know what, who wouldn't get along with this brave, masculine, healthy cowboy?\nWhat you got there?\nIt's a camera attachment.\nThat keeps the attention of your dog while you're taking its picture.\nOh.\nSchmidt came up with a great title for it.\nIt's called \"Perfect Pet Pic.\"\nThis is just a prototype that dumb-old me came up with.\nIf he put it together, it'd be a lot better, I promise you that.\nNow, of course, could-could you just hold some pet food in your other hand? Sure.\nBut this is a lifestyle product.\nThat's actually really impressive.\nI think Lori's gonna like that.\nYou know, I had a vision of what this product would look like.\nAnd you carried it out and exceeded my expectations in a way that... I don't know.\nIt-it's touching.\nSometimes I feel like you're my arms.\nI'm really proud of the way that you're handling this.\nI'm proud of the way that you've handled this.\nWhat have I handled?\nY-Your man problems.\nNo, honey, you're the one with the man problems.\nI don't have the man problems. I'm being so nice to you because you're the one who has the man problems.\nNo, no, no, sweetheart, I'm only being nice to you 'cause you have man problems, and I feel sorry...\nNo, you have man problems and that's why I'm being nice to you right now.\nHoney, honey, honey...\nWhat man problems did you think I had?\nSomething hangy.\nHang...? You think I had something hanging off...\nWhat'd you think I had?!\nI don't want to get too graphic, but I... I was picturing something gooey.\nGooey's not the worst... I've had gooey.\nOh, good God, what?\nSimply ignore it.\nWho told you about my man problems?\nWho told you about my man...?\nLook, the only reason why I did this was to get you guys to stop arguing about who's the boss...\nDon't you be sorry! Jess, you did nothing wrong!\nYou're nothing but an angel!\nYou tried to help us, which is a sweet move!\nYou tried to help a situation...\nYou're yelling nice things at me again! which was at a boiling point.\nIt's very confusing!\nNick: This is his fault!\nHe's been bossing me around for ten years!\nIf I hadn't been bossing you around, you would just be a bartender with a lot of ideas and the ambition of a dead person.\nI will never let you boss me around again.\nNot even if the lives of 100,000 children depended on it.\nFine, if-if... I take that part back.\nIf a bunch of kids' lives depended on it, I'd let you boss me around.\nYou went way too far in that moment.\nFine, but you understand my point.\nIf there were five kids whose life depended on it, I wouldn...\nNot even five kids.\nOkay, I... No kids, I don't... Pretend I...\nJust take the kids out.\nI understand the point you're trying to make!\nThe company is dead! That's the point.\nI'm going to that pitch meeting tomorrow with Lori Greiner without you.\nYou know why? Because a boss never breaks appointments.\nYou think I was born in the middle of the afternoon?\nYou're gonna go into that pitch and take all the credit?\nFine, go to that pitch together, and then me and you, we're done.\nFine, I'm done with you.\nDon't speak to me until bedtime.\nIf you think we're gonna have a bedtime chat, you're out of your mind.\nWe'll lay in beds, and we'll just over the day together like we usually do and that's it!\nNo.\nFine, we'll do that for a little bit. That's it.\nThat's it.\nHere, take it. I don't even need it anymore.\nBedtime chat's gonna be so short, you won't believe it.\nSchmidt: Oh, I'll believe it.\nYou won't believe it.\n\n\n\nThought you might not show.\nI drove you here, Nicholas.\nLet's just get through this thing, and then we can be done with each other, okay?\nOkay.\nAnd, by the way, stay out of my way in there.\nI'm about to blow the roof off of this thing with a little something I like to call the \"Seven S's.\"\nI bet you don't have any more than four.\nYeah? Watch me.\nGo ahead.\nStrategy, sizzle, Schmidt, sex...\nGo on.\nStop interrupting me. I got... I got more.\nSalesmanship.\nSomething.\nSynergy.\nBoom. Nailed it.\nDamn it.\nThat's seven... How you like me now?\nAll right, that's really good, but it's not gonna matter,\n'cause the only thing that matters is what I have.\nA prototype.\nSo stay out of my way in there, and let me just show her the prototype, because that's all we need.\n(chuckles)\nWe don't need a prototype.\nDid you forget the prototype?\nNo.\nDid you forget the prototype?\n(laughs): No.\nDid you forget the prototype?\nYeah.\nWhere'd you leave it, Nick?\nI still believe in them though.\nPart of me thinks that even though they're mad at each other, they'll get in there, and they'll figure it out.\nI don't think that's the case.\nWhy are you being so negative?\n'Cause they left their stupid thing.\nWhat?!\nOh, crap.\n I'm delivering a prototype \n And drinking a big coffee... \n(tires screech, horns honking)\nOh, crap.\nNick, what is the matter with you?\nWell, I wouldn't have forgot it if you didn't bully me to get out of the house an hour early!\nIt was too fast! I needed time!\nYou lay on the ground...!\nYou guys ready?\nYeah.\nYes, of course.\nAbsolutely.\nI'm talking about postwar.\nThat's after the war.\nPrewar would be something different completely.\nI was in London postwar, post-postwar, in '77, and, uh... I caught a few shows.\nThe flights were... Well, I think I spent two... maybe $250 to get to... (quietly): Guess who?\nWhat are you doing here?\nI'm just checking in on my investment.\nOh, my... Hey, check it out.\nI'm a campus cutie.\nNo, you are not.\nWhat are we learning?\nShh!\nI am studying Postwar British Art History.\nWhat?\nPost Br-British who? What's that?\nThat's just a bunch of words that mean \"Screw you, investors.\" What else you taking?\nIntro to Afrikaans.\nWhat else? Astronomy 101? (chuckles)\nThat's next semester.\nWinston: Wow.\nWhat you gonna do, Cece, join the South African space program and be the first woman to put a David Hockney painting on the moon?\nWho is David Hockney?\nExcuse me, can I help you?\nNo, no, we're okay, sorry.\nYes, can you please, um, tell my investment here We're okay, we're... that she can't make any money with art history.\nThat's not true.\nLast year I made almost $22,000, and my life is very hard.\nYou see that? You should be studying to become a doctor.\nThey make good money, they get respect.\nPaging Dr. Cece.\nA doctor? We wouldn't see a penny for at least 12 years.\nHere's what you should be focused on, okay?\nSomething with a low risk, high reward, and that thing...\nDo not say hotel management.\nHotel management.\nOh, my gosh.\nLook, man, it is a secure living and it's great way to meet people.\nDo you mind... telling me where I might find more information on hotel management?\nUh, the dog, uh... the dog...\nYou put the food in the thing.\nUh, and then the dog sees it, and, uh, the food's dangle-dang... uh, it's dangling.\nTo, uh, do-do-do...\nDog...\nLooks at dang-dang.\nTail wag-wag, uh, rev... dog wagging the ta...\nUm, whatever dog's name is.\nDog's name is Claire.\nClaire come in.\nWho-who's Claire?\nShh.\nUh, Claire sees dog food.\nPic, Facebook, like, like, like...\nSizzle... Pet Pic... strategy, sex, something.\nStrategy, sex, something.\nS-Something.\nSomething.\nThis is the worst pitch I have ever seen.\n(panting): Sorry. Sorry to interrupt.\nGentlemen, your prototype.\nWait, what are you wearing?\nThis? (chuckles)\nThis is the Swuit!\nIt's a suit made entirely of sweat suit material.\nIt was invented by Nick and Schmidt, and like them, it's the perfect combination.\nThat one over there, he's all creativity and ideas.\nThoughts and notions.\nAnd this one's all data and numbers.\nSix.\nHe can just keep going.\nThe Swuit goes from day to night and night to play.\nSchmidt: Take my friend Nick here for example.\nI mean, this is a man who would wear sweatpants to his wedding.\nI now pronounce me comfortable.\n(chuckles)\nLook, Lori, you get it.\nLook, Lori, you get it.\nLori, you get it.\nDo it together.\nBoth: No one doesn't love the Swuit.\nDon't settle for substitutes.\nSwettle for swub-si-swuits.\nNo?\nI've got to stop drinking on the golf course.\nTo the Swuit!\nAll: The Swuit!\nHey, how'd it go?\nShe like the Perfect Pet Pic?\nEven better.\nShe hated the Swuit.\nYeah, she's got a similar product on QVC called the Scruit.\nIt's a suit made of scrubs.\nIt was developed for prison weddings.\nYeah, paid us $10,000 to kill the Swuit.\nYeah!\nYeah!\nSo, Nick, are you finally free to do nothing?\nNot so fast there, lady.\nUh, old Schmidty-bangs and I have to get working on our next idea.\nThat is, if you'll still have me, buddy.\nCome on, man.\nOf course I'll have you.\nLook at me.\nLook at me.\nI was looking at you the whole time. Don't say anything.\nWhen I say that, just let me say that and take a moment where you're like,\n\"Wow, he's about to say something.\"\nYou kept... you kept saying it as if I wasn't looking at you.\nNick: But what I'm clearly doing is saying, \"Look at me.\"\nAnd what you're supposed to do is be like, \"Ah.\"\nAnd then I'm gonna say something.\nAh.\nLook at...\nL-Let me say it first.\nAll right, guess what?

It was a pleasure.\nPleasure.\nEasy on the puns, okay?\nAnd you've got broccoli in your teeth.\nRemember what I told you about eating at public functions?\nOnly use your back teeth.\nOnly use your back teeth.\nHey, Fawn, I'm sorry. We should probably get to Nick's bar crawl now, yeah?\nYou remember? I confirmed it like ten times with your intern.\nYes, yes, yes, no.\nFirst, I need to, uh, schmooze some vascular surgeons.\nGotta get a discount on my spider vein removal. Okay?\nOkay, ten minutes tops.\nWe're still going to dinner, 'cause it took a lot to get this reservation.\nAlso, we can't get wasted 'cause it's a very nice restaurant.\nWhich means we have to pretend to drink in front of Nick.\nIs that really necessary?\nOh, yakkety-yakkety-yak.\nDon't ruin my bar crawl.\nLet's go. Drink.\nMmm.\nMmm.\nMmm, mmm.\nBoom!\nI'm gonna outdrink you tonight, Miller.\nCece, your mouth is writing a check that your body can't find. (Winston laughs)\nThat's not an expression.\nRegionally specific to Northern Illinois.\nWe say it all the time.\nThank you, Winston.\nYou're welcome.\nDon't write a check your body can't find.\n(laughs) Every day, man.\nFor real.\nGot to. Got to.\nA gimlet for May.\nThank you.\nWatch and learn, player.\nIf you're a girl and you're in a bar on Valentine's Day, you're basically saying, \"Hello. Good February.\nI'm interested in casual sex.\"\n(chuckles) Hmm.\nMay, huh?\nThat's your name?\nYeah.\nAh, that's crazy 'cause, uh... (coughing loudly)\n(clears throat, groans)\nI know I just met you, but your name's already written... on my heart.\nIt's fate, baby.\nIt's fate... seriously?\nNick: All right, come on! Five-minute warning, let's go.\nDude, I'm kind of in the middle of something.\nOh, no, nope, you're in the middle of nothing, because that's the cheesiest thing I've ever seen.\n(chuckles) She hates you, Ernie.\nBut I don't like her for you, anyway. Let's go.\nWait, what do you mean?\nRyan: I just don't know what to do. No schools are hiring.\nI've contacted everyone I know.\nI even checked through all my contacts in England, including my old headmaster at Wellington Prep, to see if he knew of anything in the States.\n Where there's a will, there's a \n Wellington way.  (giggles)\nHow do you know the Wellington fight song?\nYou sing it in your sleep.\nOh, God.\nLook, don't worry, you're gonna find a job.\nI'm just worried about not seeing you as much if I switch schools.\nWell...\nI'll just have to sleep over more.\nOr you could move in with me.\nDid the music just get louder?\n(Nick whoops) The crawl rolls on and Winston's got the rear!\nLet's go!\nCece: Let's go.\n(whooping)\nWinston: Let's go, let's go, let's go.\nLet's go with the backpack in the back of the pack.\nHey, so listen, can't make the crawl. Bummed.\nWhat?\nBut remember... tomorrow we have that photo shoot, and I'm gonna need you to look as Mexican as possible, okay?\nIt's not okay. We should be together.\nIt's Valentine's Day.\nCome on, you don't really care about Valentine's Day, do you?\nI don't know, maybe I do.\nPlus, you owe me.\nI ran the teleprompter at your last debate... I made \"Fawn is Fine\" bumper stickers on my own dime.\nYeah.\nEven krumped at that anti-gang initiative.\n(hip-hop song playing)\nYeah, I have mixed feelings about that.\nMe, too. The point is, Yeah.\nI'm tired of always doing your things.\nWhat do you want? You want a... You want a photo op?\nOr do you want a boyfriend?\nCall me when you know what you want.\nYeah, okay.\n \nThis bar completes the eyes on my smiley face.\nMiller, man, it's just an honor to be on this bar crawl with you.\nJust serving your vision.\nAre you guys going on a bar crawl?\nI just got dumped, so this holiday is really kicking me in the penis.\nMe, too, man. Me, too.\nIt's been a real kick in the gooch.\nNot anymore, it's not.\n'Cause you're joining us.\nValentine's Day might be for couples, but the crawl is for all.\nYes. We just got our motto, folks.\nAll: The bar crawl is for all!\nGood evening, happy Valentine's Day.\nMay I offer you a piece of my hear...?\nHey.\nYou again.\nI'm curious, d-do you actually think that's gonna work?\nI mean, you tell me.\n(imitates heart pumping)\nAre you trolling bars on Valentine's Day trying to find sad single girls to hook up with you?\nI'm not gonna say yes, and I'm not gonna say no.\nBecause I know it would be a lie.\nSo yes.\nI'm gonna...\nI'm gonna take these.\nDon't!\nYep.\nPaid $3.50 for those.\nYou owe me $3.50.\nI don't know, it's just such a huge step and so early in the relationship, and I thought that I could skip the question and come back to it later, which is the strategy I taught my S.A.T. prep course.\nAll right, let's do pros and cons.\nOkay, pros... I love him.\nI love his house, I love his accent.\nWhen he says \"raccoon\" he says it like \"rac-coon.\"\nAdorable.\nCons...\nHis toaster is super-old.\nWoman: Ugh! I tried to stay out of this, but move in with him!\nYeah, well, I-I want to move in with him, but...\nNo \"but,\" there's no damn \"but.\"\nNo \"but.\"\nBut... what if I blew it by pretending I didn't hear him?\nOr maybe it wasn't that obvious.\nNah, she heard me, it was very obvious.\nI really hate to see you upset.\nYou know, if I had something to g...\nYou know what, I do have something.\nI have a bag of nuts in my bag.\nDo you want a bag of nuts?\nNick: Maybe she didn't hear you.\nYou know, she's got a lot of hair.\nMm.\nAnd hair blocks sound.\nIt happened when we were dating all the time.\nHey, did you get a chance to read my Walking Dead fan fiction, yet?\nWhat'd you think?\nWell, here's the good news, lad.\nWe have a solution.\nIt's God's gift to man.\nIt's alcohol.\nI can't.\nWe agreed to pretend-drink so we could go out to dinner.\nAre you saying that 'cause you want me to go to jail for murder?\nNo.\nNo, 'cause I'm gonna murder you if you're pretend-drinking on my bar crawl!\nAnd you're breaking my heart!\nYou can't fight the crawl.\nIt's like fighting a hurricane.\nYou know what a hurricane is?\nDo you guys have those over the pond?\nWe don't, but I know what it is.\nYou guys don't have them?\nNo.\nThey're awful.\nMm-hmm.\nIt's like fighting one of those.\nAnd a hurricane doesn't have fists, so just, bang, you lose!\nLet's drink.\nYeah, man.\nYeah!\nUSA!\nUSA!\nYeah! - USA!\nUSA! (whoops)\nAnd also where you're from!\nMmm.\nTo show respect.\nWell, happy V-Day to me.\nFawn and I are on the rocks.\nBy the way, a pun that would have killed at last week's geologist ball.\n(whispering): Let's murder her.\nWhat?!\nI want chicken wings.\nI know.\nHow many drinks you had tonight?\nNine plus three minus one.\nOh, no. That's...\nBecause I'm gonna out-drink Miller.\nYou are gonna out-drink Miller? No one out-drinks Miller.\nI do.\nI guarantee you, you don't.\nYou don't know me.\nCece, Nick just got dumped, okay?\nHe has a depth of anger and sadness that rests between his eyes, and he can drink forever and ever and ever.\nYou'll lose every time.\nHey, it's my business partner that I was telling you about... Schmidt!\nAll: Schmidt!\nNick, who are all these people?\nThese are the crawlers.\nThe single, the lonely, the close-talkers, the shockingly pale, the stank-mouths, fat boys in the back... (whoops twice)\n(crawlers whoop twice, in response) The chubby-fronts, the delusionally-okay with themselves... but no one is alone tonight because...\nAll (chanting): The crawl is for all! The crawl is for all! The crawl is for all!\nI just want chicken wings.\nOh, you're hammered, Cece.\n\n\n\nHey.\nHey, Jess, I'm drinking fire.\nThat seems dangerous.\nMm...\nUm, I wanted to talk to you about what you said before.\nWhat did I say? I can't remember.\nYou don't, you don't remember what you said?\nNo, I embraced the crawl.\nOh.\nWinston and Nick:  When it's cold outside \nThat sounded, that's where we're at.\n I've got the month of May \nI'm up here.\nGood, okay, I'm down here.\nOkay, here we go, check it out.\n I guess \n You'd say \n What can make me feel this way? \nHere we go!\n Bar crawl \n Bar crawl, bar crawl \n Talkin' 'bout bar crawl \n Bar crawl  (whooping)\nWhere my altos at?\nCome on, now, don't be shy! I see you!\n(boos, chuckles)\nOh, no.\nNick: And mic drop. Who's next?\nNo. What?!\nNo.\nDamn it!\nAre you following me?\nNo, I'm not following you, dude.\nDo you have any nicer, sluttier friends?\nYeah, I do, and I'm never introducing them to you.\nThat's messed up.\nAnd they're real dirty.\nAw!\nCan I have a gimlet, please?\nI.D.?\nSeriously? Why?\n'Cause you ordered a dumb drink.\n(goofy laughing)\n(snickering)\nOh...\n(woman sighs) COACH: Ah.\nThank you.\nYou got a Kansas license.\nThat's where I learned to drive, and I have an emotional attachment to it, and I don't need to explain that to you.\nNo, you don't, but...\nYou're from Kansas?\nYup.\nWell, I'm from all over. Army brat.\nMe, too.\nYou are?\nYes.\nUh, you ever lived in North Carolina?\nFrom 1989 to 1992.\nI lived there in '93.\nNo.\nYou ever live in Germany?\nDusseldorf in '96!\nLived there in '97!\nThat's so weird.\nSo, we've, like, just missed each other for our entire lives.\nAnd then we meet, like, three times in a row in one night.\n(laughs) Seems a little weird.\nIt's kind of like, uh...\nFate?\nNo.\nI know! I can't believe I said that!\nWhy did you say that?\nThat's so cheesy.\nOh, I hate that!\nNick: Hey, Coach!\nCoach!\nI don't know them.\nI got a female condom if you need it, my man! (whoops)\nDon't hold this against me, please.\nCece (groaning): Oh, God...\nHere, Cece, have some water.\nNo, thank you. No.\nValentine's Day just sucks.\nI don't know. I kind of like it.\nSince when?\nSince a few years ago... since three years ago, to be exact.\nOh, what happened three...?\nOh.\nIt was when you first took a chance on me.\nAnd we humped until the sun came out.\nDid all the things that R. Kelly raps about.\nYeah, I know. I was there.\nIt was the best night of my life, and ever since then, Valentine's Day has always been my favorite holiday, and I hope that you don't remember that I have said any of these things tomorrow.\nOh, it's gonna happen again.\nIt's gonna... Oh.\nIt's gonna happen again.\nAll right.\nOh...\n(coughing)\nSomehow, this isn't repulsive.\nIt's not great, but it certainly isn't the worst.\nJess: I'm so sorry that I pretended not to hear you.\nIt's just that... I wasn't ready for it, and sometimes you mumble with your accent, and I never fully understand you.\nI'm sorry.\nI'm sorry.\nI asked you to move in with me out of the blue.\nWhat kind of... nutter does that?\nThe craziest mother nutter in the whole damn place!\nRyan Geauxinue, will you move in with me?\nI have my own home.\nYou live in a loft with four guys and a urinal.\nWill you move in with me?\nYes.\nYes?\nYes!\nYes!\nAbsolutely.\nYes!\nYes!\n(giggles)\nNick: Home base! (groans)\nBarkeep, bring us beer.\nIf you call me barkeep one more time, I'm shutting this bitch down.\nMike, I love you because you're gay... and 'cause you're dangerous.\nI can't believe I used to have a crush on you.\n(groans)\nHey, man. How's it going?\nI'm not hooking up tonight.\nI met one girl.\nSeveral times.\nShe's pretty much perfect.\nNice. Where's she at?\nI ditched her, dude.\nShe's, like, relationship material.\nThat's not what I'm looking for tonight.\nReally?\nYeah, I want something easy.\nSomething easy?\nLike Sunday morning.\nLike Sunday morning. Know what I'm saying?\nI know what you're saying.\nThat bitch is a Monday.\nKnow what I'm saying?\nYou know what's funny?\nI got something just for that.\nYou're gonna love it. Here it is.\nI can't wait.\nGive it to me right...\nYo!\nGo get that girl, dude.\n(whining): I don't even know where she is.\nI didn't hit you that hard.\nHey. (grunts)\nThis, uh, Schmidt's jacket you're wearing?\nYeah.\nNot to be a nosy buddy, but sparks are flying like the Wright brothers between you two.\nAnd I would know.\nI have their biography here in my backpack.\nI care about Schmidt, but just as a friend, all right?\nLook me in the eyes, and tell me you don't have feelings for Schmidt.\nI don't have feelings for him.\nDude, you are nowhere near my eyes.\nNobody hit on me. I'm taken.\nDon't talk to me. I'm a councilwoman.\nSchmidt?\nDid the whole crawl to find you.\nI'm cold, I'm tired, I'm sober.\nI'm wearing my strapless bra like a belt.\nBut I know what I want.\nI want you.\nI want you to be my boyfriend.\nAs much as a I want a commuter lane to Costa Mesa! (crowd whooping)\nVote Moscato!\n(crowd cheering)\nWhat?\nThey're kissing.\nI thought maybe you were gonna say something like,\n\"No\" or, like, \"I miss him so much now.\"\nLast call! (groans)\nWe got one more bar on the crawl!\nWe have to finish the smile!\nYou're never ever gonna make it.\nAnd I'm never gonna ride a jet ski with Tom Colicchio on my back.\nSo, sometimes dreams just don't come true.\n(shouting): I'm sorry about that guy Galecky not hugging you from behind in the water on a motorized thing... I'm sorry!\nWe will finish what we have started!\n(cheering) Yay!\nWe will feast on the spoils of this night for a thousand moons!\nIn the name of love and booze!\n(crawlers cheering)\nOh, no. My crush is back.\nI hate myself.\n(cell phone buzzes)\nOh, this person will not stop texting me.\nWhere is it? (phone continues buzzing)\nSorry.\nOh, it's an e-mail from Wellington Prep.\nYou do realize we were just about to have sex, right?\nSay something to get back in the mood... say raccoon.\nThey're offering me the job of headmaster.\nIn England?\nRaccoon?\nSo, you'd be the headmaster?\nHeadmaster.\nOf Wellington?\nOf Wellington.\n(sighing): Headmaster.\nJess... look at me.\nI'm not gonna take it.\nWellington's not even that great.\nYou have their current headmaster as your emergency contact.\nOkay, it's heaven on Earth.\nAnd I love it.\nBut I love you more.\nWell, I love you, which is why I can't let you pass up this opportunity!\nIf we were ready to live in the same place, then we should be ready to live 5,000 miles apart.\nYeah, I suppose, but...\nWell, I'll call you every night after work. It'll only be, like, midnight your time.\nI could learn to stay up late. Maybe I should try cocaine!\nYeah! Or coffee!\nThat, too.\nAnd I'll come and visit.\nIt's only, like, an 11-hour flight.\nAnd then a four-hour drive to Wellington.\nThat's so long!\nWhich is great... 'cause I can catch up on podcasts.\nWe can do this!\nWe can do this long distance, right?\nRight.\nNick (in distance): This is our revolution!\n(crowd clamoring outside)\nWhen I say bar, you say...\nAll: Crawl!\nBar!\nCrawl!\nJess, are you guys coming or what?\nHi.\nMay!\nMay!\nHey.\nYou again.\nYeah.\nMe again.\nLook, um, I'm sorry about earlier.\nI just, I-I really didn't plan on-on meeting somebody so great tonight, you know?\nYou messed everything up!\n'Cause you're, like, awesome and that sucks because it's, like, that's not what I want. And you're pretty, which is a bummer.\n'Cause it's, like, damn! She fine, but it's, like, at the same time, I'm, like, I don't need this in my life.\nYou wear a leather jacket...\nI'm sorry. Are you... I'm just confused.\nAre you trying to say something nice right now?\nYes. I am.\nAnd I'm terrible at it.\nIs there any way I could get, I ca...

Nick's cracking a little bit.\nEverybody, relax, okay?\nIt's just the crawl's over.\nKai is over.\nI got nothing to do.\nI just have nothing to do.\nCome on.\nOf course, you have so much to do.\nNick we're business partners, man.\nWe're teammates.\nYOu're smart and talented guy.\nAnd tonight we found out that you have a weird, _ charisma.\nYou should make more maps man.

Hello?\nSounds like I lost you for a minute!\n(chuckles)\nAre you there?!\nWhere's my widdle Eng-wish man?\nAnd with that, Ryan walked into the River Thames and accepted death.\nThe joke's on you, 'cause I wasn't even talking to him.\nI was leaving a voice mail.\nHaven't talked to him for a week.\nAre you guys making a group face?\nNo, we're not...\nNo.\nNah.\nGuys, look, Ryan and I are great.\nReally?

Sorry.\nI was talking to Ryan before he went to work and I must have fallen asleep.\nFriend to friend, am I wearing pants?\nThe situation isn't ideal, however, long distance is super romantic.\nPlus I don't have to shave my legs every day which is a real plus.\nYou know, Fawn shaves herself from toe to chin.\nEvery single day.\nGod, I love my girlfriend.\nHey.

Do... do not go and talk to him.\nDo not go and talk to him.\nCece, not everything's about you, you narcissist.\nAll right, just... go to the bathroom, like you said you'd...\nAnd... he's talking to him.\nJust don't look. Just don't look. Oh, well, he's looking at you.\nWhat? What? Really?\nNo, like, right now, he's staring at you.\nDon't, don't, don't, don't look, don't look.\nDon't look. The cutest one's looking right at me.\nI don't see a \"cute\" or \"not cute\" one, Coach.\nIf you had to choose, which one's the cutest?\nWay to the left.\n(whispering): I'm super nervous.\nNow my hands are sweating.\nThen wipe 'em off.\nIf he comes over and shakes your hand, you don't want sweaty hands.\nOh, my God!\nSchmidt: He said he thinks you're cute.\nCece: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\nJess: Hey, Nick, can I have my phone?\nYou know what? Never mind.

It was funny.\nWinston: It made me laugh.\nWho wants scramblies?\nYou know I do, Mom.\n(voice breaking): Good.\n(crying)\nLook, this might not be the right time to say this, you guys, but, uh, should we take a straw poll on this whole Cosby thing?\nJess: I just want to clarify to everyone here that I am fine.\nWhich is why I'm fine.\nGreat!\nYeah.\nFiner than fine.\nMm-hmm.\nCoach: Which is why I'm fine.\nSchmidt: Fantastic!\nCece: I'm fine, too. Everybody's great.\nSchmidt: Perfect.\n(stifled crying)\nI'm not fine!\nNick: I can't do this anymore.\nIt's not all smiles and sunshine.\nIt's not!\nLook, Ryan bailed and that's a dick move.\nAnd that's the truth.\n(crying): I'm fine, I'm just gonna go to my room.\n(crying): I made scones.\n(door slams)\nWas that sunshine or smiles?

Claire and Leo, or... whatever blonde Leo is taking on boats.\nThey're all doomed.\nLeo ain't gonna settle down... He ain't ready.\nI'm a hopeless romantic, and I always have been.\nWhich is why...\nI mean, it's a nice notion, it's just... from 1994 to 2001, I believed that Jordan Catalano was gonna show up in my driveway after a dirt bike accident, all scruffy and... beautiful... and he would need a bath and some... medical attention.\nYou think that little boy is driving a dirt bike?\nHe looks a lot like you.\nThat's me, that's Jordan Catalano.\nI honestly couldn't tell the difference.\nI swear to God. I'm not trying to be mean.\nYou know what the problem with Jordan Catalano is?\nYeah... an undiagnosed learning disability.\nOh, I didn't know the boy had mental problems...\nI wouldn't be teasing him, but...\nNo, it's that he's fake.\nThe only thing that matters is if the guy is there for you when you need him.\nOtherwise, you're dating a wall.\nI have to get to my dad's wedding. I didn't...\nI didn't come in here trying to be harsh, I'm ju...\nI was trying to be helpful and it's not working and I apologize.\nI was coming in as a friend, Je...\nI'm sure that's just her.\nWell, the dream's dead.\nApparently, Jake Apex has to work, so he's not gonna come to the wedding.\nI'm wearing the craziest underwear for nothing.\nOkay, look, Cece, you know what we do? We regroup.\nNo, it's fine, Schmidt. I'm over it.\nIt is not fine.\nLook, Cece, you're the most amazing woman I ever met.\nIf you want Jake Apex, I'm gonna help you get Jake Apex.\nI'm never gonna stop trying to make you happy, Cece.\nI promise you, for the rest of my...\n(phone ringing)\nOh, look at that, it's Fawn.\nHello, Councilwoman Moscato.\n(quietly): Oh, yeah.\n(panting): Guys!\nI forgot the rings at the house.\nThey're in my purse in my room.\nAnd now I have to go get my dad ready.\nApparently, he's wearing some kind of a male corset.\nAll right, Coach and I will get the rings...\nYou don't have a car.\nAll right. Okay.\nWait!\nAll right.\nLet's do this.\n(chuckles): Yeah.\nOkay. Okay.\nOkay, ready?\nYep, yep.\nGo easy. I'm not on!\nYou're not?!\nI'm not on!

I don't know why that would be the case at all, but that's cool... I respect the decision for her to come over.\nWhy are you acting weird?\nI'm acting weird?\nMm.\nDo you know something?\nDo...?\nYou... I'm not a smooth man.\nIs she mad at someone?\nAh... no.\nNo.\nNo, she's not mad at anyone.\nIt's the opposite.\nMm.\nIt's the opposite?\nThat's not what I said.\nYou said, \"No, no, she's not mad at anyone.\nIt's the opposite.\"\nI said, \"Whoa, whoa.\n\"Cheese is bad e'ryone.\nLet's stop and spit.\"\nThe opposite of mad is...\nDoes she like someone?\nWhat would make you assume that would be...?\nI can hear it.\nI can hear it building its house.\nBuilding its sticky, deadly house that you can never leave.\nBuilding it.\nWith its ass.\nWe're breaking up into two-person teams.\nCece.\nEach team has one Smusher and one Jar-Man.\nNick, I'm gonna make you a Smusher since you have to stir.\nHey, am I stirring right now?\nOr is my arm still, and the world is stirring?\nCoach, you're a Jar-Man.\nMm.\nYou're with Schmidt.\nCece, with your delicate little hands, you're a born Jar-Man.\nOkay.\nWhich means I need to pair you up with a Smusher.\nI smush.\nThat'd be me.\nSmusher for life.\nYou're such a Jar-Man.\nYou don't even know you're a Jar-Man, Jar-Man.\nYeah, you are.\nYou're a born J-man. Come on, Winston.\nUh, Cece.\nYeah.\nBefore we get started, you want to have a quick Jar-Man strategy session?\nA little Jar-Jar strat sesh?\nAre you winking or farting?\nThe only strategy is... find the spider, kill the spider, mount the spider's head on top of the roof so all the other spiders know.\nAll right. And spiderhunt!\nSpiderhunt!\nSpiderhunt!\nYou find that thing... you-you make sure that it's done.\nThat's the plan, that's...\nOkay.\nHey, what do you think Jess and Cece are talking about?\nOh, probably that stupid movie theater popcorn machine that Cece wants me to get for the bar.\nShe keeps haranguing me about it.\n\"Popcorn machine, popcorn machine.\"\nLook, I don't know what void Cece's trying to fill in her life...\nI don't know, either. Why would I know?\nYou know, I don't know what void she's trying to fill.\nIt's all she wants to talk about.\nOh.\nStupid movie theater popcorn machine.\nI'm like, \"Shut up, dude.\"\nYou put bologna in your Bolognese?\nWhere else would it get its name?\nTrick question... it gets it from the mayonnaise.\nYeah, yeah.\nYou got it.\nDo you think a good subject line is, \"The Inside of You\"?\nHey, you know, I bet I could spot this spider a lot better if I was on your shoulders.\nDo not ask me again to get on my shoulders.\nThat's a once-a-year thing, and you already used it on Halloween, when we were ten-foot-tall Ralph Macchio.\nOw! Damn it!\nThat was cool.\nI didn't like that. I could feel your genitals on the back of my neck like an airplane pillow.\nOkay, you know what? How about this?\nI'm not sure why he did it but I sure am glad that God rearranged the letters in yam to... create something even sweeter.\nWhat?\nMay.\nOh, May, yeah. Yeah, all right.\nKeep going, keep going.\nOh, dear God.\nIt's left the web to feed.\nAll right, I'll put that.\nSeems like a weird thing to say.\nLots of bars have popcorn machines.\nI really think that people would dig it.\nThey're not that expensive.\nAnd everybody loves fresh popcorn.\nDo you like somebody in the loft?\nWinston.\nOkay, what did he tell you?\nHe told me you like someone but he won't name names.\nIs it Schmidt? Do you like Schmidt again?\nNo. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\nAbsolutely not. No.\nWho is it then? Who?\nI want to tell you. I want to tell you so, like, so badly... You know me...\nI want to tell you so bad, I just, um, I'm very sorry, but I can't.\nRight, right, right, right, you can't tell anybody... except freaking Winston!\nThat slow puzzler!\nI know. I'm lower down on the food chain No!\nThan Officer Cat Fancy?!\nNo. No, no, no, no. It's just I know that you would do anything to help me, and in this situation, you know, there's just nothing to be done.\nAnd we both know that you would just want to get involved.\nWell, I can stay uninvolved.\nI want to tell you, but I can't.\nI just can't.\nOkay. That's fine. Okay.\nThat's cool, that's cool. New teams!\nYou have to tell me who she likes.\nThere are no secrets between Jar-Man and Smusher.\nPlease!\nShe's my best friend. You have to tell me.\nOkay.\nLook, Jess... she likes me.\nIt's me she wants.\nNot even for a second.\nI thought I was convincing.\nYeah.\nI need you to close your eyes and taste it.\nOkay.\nOh... Oh, Nick... It's legit terrible.\nWell, you taste for texture not taste you big old...\nNot really what I was looking for at this stage.\nDefinitely affects my confidence.\nWait. Wait!\nThe only person that Cece could like that she wouldn't want to tell me about... is Nick!\nUh...\nDoes Cece like Nick?\nDoes Cece like...?\nOh, my...\nNo... you guessed it.\nHow you did that?\nOh, my God. My ex-boyfriend and my best friend?\nI feel like... Brenda when Kelly dated Dylan!\nOr the other way around.\nNow I know those are the characters from the original 90210.\nBut that's about my ceiling. Dylan... was his nickname the Peach Pit? 'Cause I remember...\nI remember that being a whole thing.\nI'm sorry, I'm a little wound up.\nYou should be wound up because the Peach Pit used to be yours, but now Brenda want a slice.\nEverybody trying to get a slice of that Peach Pit.\nYou have every right to be mad, Jess, but just do it quietly.\nYou know, just do it on the low, do it in here.\n30 seconds, and you haven't brought up the popcorn machine.\nYeah, well, I guess I'm just gonna have to drop it.\nYou know, even Jess didn't want to hear about it, and she'll listen to Schmidt discussing Andy Cohen discussing Bethenny discussing NeNe.\nWell, great, I'm glad that's behind us.\nYeah.\nNow let's never speak of popcorn machines again.\n\n\n\nCece and Nick?\nCece likes Nick?\nCece likes Nick?!\nI mean, I guess I understand it 'cause they're at the bar together and once you start sharing tips, where does the sharing end?\nLook... Jess, it's not that big of a deal.\nBecause we all just cats and dogs at the end of the day.\nWhat about Schmidt? Schmidt's Nick's best friend, and Schmidt and Cece have a history.\nLook at the memory on you.\nI'm gonna have to help Schmidt through this.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\nLook, Jess, you can't talk to Schmidt about Cece liking Nick.\nCome on.\nNo, you're right. I have to talk to Cece first.\nRight, you got to talk to Ce... No, wait, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Jess, you can't talk to Cece because Cece, you know, and Nick, they just won't work. 'Cause I was talking to Nick.\nHe said, \"Winston.\" I was like, \"What's up, Nick?\" He said...\nWhat?\nHe said she ugly.\nHe said what?!\nYeah, he said she look like a dang ol' meatball with hair.\nNew teams!\nYou know who's great?\nCece. One of our finest.\nLovely woman.\nAnd she has so much to offer.\nIs that what this is about?\nShe sends you to sell me on it?\nNo, Nick. She doesn't know I'm talking to you at all. Wait.\nYou guys have talked about it?\nAll the time.\nBut I thought she and I had come to a decision.\nWhich is?\nIt's not happening.\nWell, why not? 'Cause I'm not interested.\nAnd I know it's not cool to say, but...\nI don't like the way it would look.\nPeople are gonna say what they're gonna say. They're not reasons not to go through with it.\nFine. You want to know my biggest concern?\nMy biggest concern is the smell.\nThe smell?\nThe smell of it.\nYeah, and it's not Cece's fault.\nI mean, they all smell. I've told her that.\nYou told Cece you think all women...\nDon't make this a feminist thing...\nIt... I'm not making it a feminist thing.\nHow? They smell terrible. It's common knowledge.\nI thought your biggest concern would be how it affected the people around you.\nI mean, sure, a bunch of old drunks will grab at it...\nBut if your biggest concern is the smell, I'm sure that's highly manageable.\nYeah, I guess there's, like, special solvents and soaps.\nI-I haven't read up on it that much.\nYou know, but you got to really get in there and scrub it out.\nIt's disgusting.\nYou know, 'cause of the daily wear and tear and... oil and grease just cooking in there.\nIt's enough to make a man barf thinking about it.\nI mean, they get really hot.\nI know what temperature it gets.\nHot.. But if I'm being honest, you know... And I haven't talked to her about this... but... I do have good memories associated with the smell.\nBall games, the circus, hanging with my dad.\nListen here, you idiot.

It's super hot.\nI don't want to, uh...\nOkay, that's just a picture of you in a bra over a T-shirt Holding a sign that says \"Property of Pete.\"\nNot a sext.\nI'm wearing a bra!\nNo, that's like a glorified selfie.\nYou can see the bra.\nNope.\n(scoffs) I bet he saw this, and he was like, (in low voice): \"Oh, delicious.\"\nYou want him to say that?\nI have to agree, (phone blipping) because the true nature of eroticism is what is not shown.\nCoach: I never get sexts.\nWhat are you taking?\nJust some, uh... motion sickness pill.\nIt's a mild sedative.\nMy mom just landed.\nThat's unrelated.\nOh, my God, your mom's here?!\nI'm so excited to meet her.\nYou probably won't; she's busy.\nBut maybe, hopefully, I doubt it.\nI can't believe I've never met her.\nYou know, we get together and we laugh and...\n(sighs) she tells me all the ways that I could be better at things, and then I do them, but not right.\nOh, it's fun.\nWe have, we have fun.\nYou know, I wish I had fun with my partner.\nWow, every time I ask Aly to hang out, she's always like, \"Nah.\"\nNick: Hey, Schmidty, vamos.\nI want to show you a surprise investment opportunity.\nSurprise, Nick? I'm telling you right now, if it is a boat, I'm gonna be so psyched!\nI literally jut got new boat shoes.\nJess: (sputters) Standing here like a damn jabroni.\nHe hasn't even answered any of my texts.\nHe hasn't?\nYou don't think he's...\n(gasping) He is blowing you off!\nHe best not be!\nHell no!\nYou guys are getting riled up, huh?\nWe are gonna march right over there, and we all right gonna find out what's happening!\nLet's go.\n(door closes) (groans)\nTurns out that Pete had a very good excuse for not showing up.\nHe died.\nWhat?\nWinston:  Just got out of the shower \n Guess who cleaned everything? \n Guess who got in deep? \nWhat?\nA motorcycle accident? I didn't even know Pete rode one.\nHe didn't. Apparently, he was thinking about getting one, and he slipped and fell on the showroom floor.\nBuffed floors... beautiful, but at what cost?\nThe first guy I sext dies.\nI should go to the memorial, right?\nJess, don't make this about yourself, all right?\nYou went on two dates with the guy.\nI was one of the last people to text him.\nOn Earth.\nCece: Look, you didn't even have sex with him, okay? You're fine.\nSo if I'd slept with him, I'd go.\nOr if you'd gone skiing together.\nMm-hmm, yeah.\nWhat are these rules?\nCoach: Just don't go.\n'Cause if you go, then I'm gonna feel weird about not going, and I ain't going.\nYeah, just come and have a mani-pedi with me.\nI'm going; it's the right thing to do.\nOh, so if I don't go, I'm a bad person now?\nCece.\nMm-hmm.\nI'm surprised. I thought you, of all people, would want to accompany your best friend to the funeral of a guy she texted, but...\nI guess... not.\n Ta-da! \nWhat do you mean?\nWhat is ta-da? We drove here together and parked before you covered my eyes.\nWhat is the surprise investment, Nick?\nThe bar.\nMike's selling us ten percent.\nI really need the cash.\nI got swindled by a young gay roller skater.\nA rink twink.\nI know what a rink twink is, Mike.\nHey, 20 thou and we are part owners, okay?\nI've done my research.\nThere's a consistent revenue and no startup costs.\nYou're really serious about this, huh?\nI really want this, man.\nGood. I want this, too.\nGood.\nWhere are we gonna get 20 grand from?\nWell, we got the ten grand we made on the Swuit.\nMaybe do we have any rich friends we can borrow money from?\nWell, let's think about it. There's the middle school vice principal, there's the cop, the gym teacher.\nLet's not forget about the community college student.\nWhew, lot of options.\nYeah.\nIt's tough, it's frustrating.\nYeah, huh... damn it.\nSchimdty just had an idea. I know that face.\nGive it to me, give it to me.\nWhat are you thinking, big cat?\nWhat are you thinking, big cat?\nI just...\n(grunts) Think, now, if we own it, don't be kicking it.\nJust... Yeah, oh.\nAah!\nOuch.\nOkay.\nHey, pal, uh, what's happening?\nMy mom still owes me my bar miztvah money.\nI mean, we can ask her, but, you know, she's...\nPushy, overbearing, controlling.\nSo, what?\nOh, she's a typical Jewish mom?\nIt's anti-Semitic when you say it like that.\nSo-so what, she likes to get involved?\nThat's great, you know.\nI don't feel very comfortable when I'm around her.\nWell, boo-hoo, she thinks you want to have sex with her.\nTry learning about the birds and the bees from her using a doughnut and a banana. By the way, neither one of which are used for what you think they are.\nHow could that be?\nHey, want to grab a bite later?\nYou know it, partner.

Thank you.\nHave it.\nHere, have it, have it, have it.\nI'll just have one.\nHave it, have it.\nHave it, have it.\nThere you go. I do love it. Hmm!\nSo, I... What I was thinking about was... uh... my bar mitzvah money.\nCan I have it?\nOh, my God! Of course you can! Yes.\nOh, that was... yeah, so easy.\nAs soon as you write your thank-you notes.\nYou didn't forget, did you?\nHe never did his thank-you cards.\nSchmidt: Mom, I just thought that you know, that was so long ago...\nWell, you know.\nIf I just gave you the money, what kind of lesson would that be?\nYou finish your cards, you get the money.\nThat's fair, isn't it?\nYou didn't finish your thank-you cards?\nThere's a hat in the bag, too. Try it on.\nPut it on.\nThat's very nice.\nTake it off, you're in a restaurant.\nSure about this? It's not too late to bail.\nWe're going.\nIt's the right thing to do.\nLook, we'll be in and out of there in five minutes.\nIt'll be so packed, no one will notice.\n(whispering): The right thing to do.\nIs it?\nAnd uh... Pete said...\n\"If you gotta puke, Duffy, just puke.\"\nAlmost time to tell the story about your close friend Pete.\nI'm just gonna tell the truth.\nWe went on a few dates. That's it.\nI'm Val, Pete's girlfriend.\n(sobs) I'm sorry.\nWould you mind going?\nHow did you know Pete?\n(clears throat quietly)\nUm, from work.\nWe worked together.\nYou're a sports agent, too?\nWow...\nYep.\nOkay, we got a lot of thank-you cards to write and not a lot of time.\nLet's get into it. I'll start, okay?\nLet's go, here we go.\n\"To whom it may concern...\"\nTo... to whom it may concern?\nI'm on a vibe.\nNick, these need to have personal details.\nMy mom is gonna check them.\nAll right, then get me the guest list.\nWhere have you imagined that I've been holding onto the guest list for all these years?\nJust carrying it around in my wallet? This is impossible.\nThis is gonna take some serious detective work.\n(chuckles)\nIt's a good thing I can call backup.\nHey.\nYou said this was a work thing.\nIt is a work thing.\nIt's a... work-style thing.\nYou see, we need your skills to solve a cold case.\n(hip-hop playing)\n \nAly: Hey, you want your bar mitzvah money? Tell me her name.\nI don't remember.\nI don't believe you!\nJust relax. Relax. Here, Schmidt.\nSip that.\nWant to hear the music again?\n(hip-hop music playing)\nAll right, there we go.\nUh-huh.\nYeah, you're 13 years old, everybody's feeling it...\n Motown Philly's back again...  - Enough.\nWhat was her name?!\nSharon Rosenberg!\nOkay. 257 Sea Cove Drive, 11021.\nOkay. \"Dear Mrs. Rosenberg...\nThank you for the check.\"\nI need a personal detail!\nPersonal detail!\nShe had a pool.\n\"Cannonball!\nLove, Schmidt.\" \nWinston: Cannonball!\nOkay, Schmidt.

Guys, wait.\nNo, stop... guys.\nThe only sport I know is Ricky Ball, and I'm pretty sure my friend Ricky made that up.\nNo. Lying about who you are is not the right thing to do.\nI am going.\nCoach...\n(whimpering) Is this, uh... is this Pete's thing? He was my agent.\nOf course he was.\nWho else would represent NFL star J.J. Watt?\nUh, Pete was my best friend and, uh...\nGod, it's good to see you.\nLouise: Wouldn't the couch be better over there? All that light?\nOr do you like to live like a radish, underground?\nSo we worked really hard on the... on the cards.\nLet's see what we got.\nOkay.\nBut you know what would be better?\nConnie's into gardening.\nYou should mention that.\nAnd if you really want your card to pop, you can use a nice fountain pen on silver stationery.\nAnd you should sign your full name, not just Schmidt.\nI mean, you have a lovely first name.\nGreat! I'll just make all those changes, Mom!\n\n\n\n(door slams) Okay.\nYou're not getting me into your pants, you little jackhammer.\nOh, I don't want you in my pants, Louise.\nOkay. Okay. Okay.\nSo then Pete says to...\nAllen Iverson.\n\"...you want to keep sportsing on the... \"\nGrizzlies.\nJess: \"...but if you want me to show you the money, then... You gotta finish your career off with the '76ers!\"\n(chuckles) And it was classic Pete.\nIt's so nice to remember work as more than just a thing that kept Pete on the phone all the time.\nYou're very welcome.\nOh, Val, you should have Pete's phone.\nAll those memories and photos...\nIt's in the garage with all his stuff.\nI'll give it to you before you go.\nVal: Thank you.\nMm-hmm.\nOkay, we gotta find that phone before Val sees the sext.\nYes, it is the right thing to do.\nLike I've said all along. I got a good thing going with J.J. and I'm not gonna let you ruin it.\nThat's the funeral spirit.\nWhat are you guys doing in here?\nWhat are you doing here?\nI'm looking for Pete's phone.\nSo are we! Did you sext him, too?\nNo. I fired Pete over text, so I didn't want to crush his family.\nThat's why I'm at the memorial.\nNot because it was the right thing to do?\nNo. No. I mean, we never even went skiing.\nWho makes up these rules?\nNow...\nWhat are you guys doing out here?\nUm...\nSinging.\nS... What?\nWe like to sing.\nTogether. About...\nSports.\nFood.\nSports foods.\nVal: That's fun.\nIt's...\nWould you guys...\nWould it be putting you on the spot if I asked you to do one?\nI think that wouldn't be appropriate.\nCoach: Actually, yes.\nI feel like it's a little...\n Hot dogs \n Hot dogs... \n Everybody loves hot dogs \n Hot dogs \n Dogs \n Everybody's favorite treat is hot dogs \n Hot dogs \n Pretzels! \nWhoa, partner!\nWait up! (laughs)\nThat work-style thing was pretty fun.\nLet's parlay that into a beer.\nMy buddy has a bar he works at, down the street.\nIt's carpeted, so...\nBishop, what don't you get?\nNo.\n(SUV door opens, shuts)\n(engine starts)\nAre you okay?\nOh, hey, man. Thanks.\nYeah, I don't know, man. It's just...\n(shushes)\nI'm talking to a ladybug.\nSqueeze my hand!\nJust one more push! You're almost there!\nThe first child is always the hardest!\nHey, bud.\nHard candy?\nIs it butterscotch?\nNo, 'cause we're friggin' strangers.\n(laughs): \"Is it butterscotch?\"\nSo, you freaked out a little back there, didn't you?\nNot to use some Popsicle psychology...\n\"Popsicle psychology\"?\nYeah, it's pop psychology for short.\n'Cause, you know, you eat the Popsicle and you love it so much and then you're stuck holding the-the stick?\nYou get it. you get it.\nNot really, but...\nI think you have some pent-up resentment towards your mom.\nShe's trying to control you!\nShe treats you like a little baby who can't do anything for himself.\nThat's why I never wrote the cards in the first place.\nGo tell that to your mom!\nShe'll understand.\nI don't understand.\nThe couch looks good here though, doesn't it?\nIt opens up the whole room.\nLouise, I think what your boy is trying to say is...\nShut it, Nick.\nHoney, why do you hang out with him?\nYou know Nancy Borkow? Her son just moved to L.A.\nHe wrote a movie script for the movies.\nI can connect you. You need better friends!\nEnough, Mom!\nYou don't get to choose my friends!\nYou don't get to choose anything!\nBecause this is my life!\nIt's my dream and nothing's gonna stop me now!\nIt feels like that's from something.\nIt feels like, it feels like it's from a movie or something.\n My life \nYeah, I think it's a song. It's a song.\nLike some sort of song, right?\nIt's the Perfect Stranger theme.\nWell, you know, it doesn't matter!\nYou know, we did a good job with those cards, Mom.\nAnd we don't need any of your money.\nWhoa, we're all being very emotional.\nLet's just slow everything...\nI'm moving the couch back!\nGosh!\nDid you nail that thing down?\nThat's... You move that all by yourself?\nI'm an adult man, Mom.\nAnd Nick is my best friend in the whole wide world.\nAnd we're gonna buy a small portion of that bar without any of your help.\n(sighs) (door slams)\nAnd also, there's some leftover chili in the fridge if you get hungry, and, please, make sure to put a plate over it before you put it in the microwave.\nI don't want it to splatter everywhere!\n And that's why they call it \n The out-of-peanuts \n Blues... \n Stadium taco. \nThank you guys for being a bright spot on my sad day.\n(screams) Aah!\nShucks!\nSorry!\nI thought I saw Pete's ghost!\nIt was a paint can. (laughs)\n(all chuckle) Are you sure about...?\nUgh! We gotta find this phone.\nAnd get the hell out of here.\nOkay, it's ringing.\nCan anybody hear it?\n(cell phone ringing) Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\nThere's another box.\nWhat the hell...? \"Property of Pete\"?\nHe made my sext his called I.D.?\nThis is a sext?\nJJ fired him over text!\nAfter the day I had, I needed this.\nMe, too.\nWhat happened?\nI know you were talking to yourself.\nNow you're talking to a stranger.\nGet over it.\nIs that a crime in California? What happened?\nI got dragged to a random dude's funeral.\nWho dragged you? My friend. She always thinks she knows what's best.\nWho's your friend... me? (both laugh)\nNo.\nI got accused of that today by my son.\nHe's tired of me babying him.\nBut he's my baby, so what am I supposed to do?\nMaybe you have to let go a little.\nThis is why strangers talk.\nYou're a genius.\nWant to see a picture of my son? He's handsome.\nNah. I'm kind of in love with my ex, so...\nAll right, you can't date him anyway.\nYou're not Jewish, so over my dead body and all that.\n(laughs)\n(laughs)\nToday was not a win for me.\nIt's the right thing to do.\nI don't even know what that means.\nWell, you made today about yourself.\nMm.\nNot to use popcorn psychology, but it's human nature.\nYou know? Soon as I saw JJ walk in, I was, like, \"JJ Watt, be my best friend.\"\n(both chuckle)\n(sighs)\nI got to do something.\nShould I tell Aly off? Uh... put in for a new partner?\nWhat's the right thing to do here?\nI can say with 100% certainty I have no idea.\nLook at you. I'm proud of you.\nI learned from the best.\nThat's awesome.\nWhat a wonderful moment we're having today!\nYou know what? I'll figure it out myself.\nThank you.\nThis is from that sixth grader over there.\n(quietly): Hmm?\nAly, what are you doing here?\nI just wanted to explain. Look...\nI hung out a lot with my last partner.\nAnd we got close and...\nYou shot him?\nWhat?\nHe died?\nNo.\nOh, my goodness... is he...?\nDid he survive?\nWhat are you talking about?\nHow did you partner die?\nHe didn't die!\nSo, what's your point?\nHe just fell in love with me!\nOh... oh! Oh!\nYeah.\nOoh...\nAnd it messed everything up.\nAnd I just don't want that to happen again.\nDamn, you're conceited!\nDon't nobody want your babies.\nI know that now!\nI mean, you brought me to your loft and showed me a bar mitzvah video.\nFriends?\nCool, cool.\nJust, uh... don't go falling in love with me.\n'Cause I'm lovable as hell.\nOkay.\nI think I'll be okay.\nAll right.\nAnother!\n(whoops)\nOh, my.\nMichael... we'd like to buy your share of the bar.\nAnd although we don't have the full $20,000 at the present...\nYou don't have the money? No.\nBut we're the right guys.\nNo, the right guys would have the money.\nOr Kieran Culkin's mouth.\nHow about Owen Wilson's nose?\n(groans)\nMom?\nOh, my God!\nSchmidt, is this your mom?\nHi. I've heard so much about you.\nHow's Long Island?\nAny cute Schmidt stories?\nI need less from you.\nOkay.\nI met a Mexican woman at the nail salon... who made me realize...\nI need to let go.\nYou're a man.\nAnd you deserve your bar mitzvah money.\nThanks, Mom.\nMike, we want to buy your ten percent of the bar.\nThis bar?!\nThere's a dying catfish laying on the sidewalk out front!\nThis would be a hilarious time for me to back out... but okay.\nYes! We're part owners!\nBoth (chanting): We're part owners!\nHow great this moment?\nI just think you'd be more of a success socially if you let people come to you.\nYou know what's fun?\nI'm not gonna be able to sleep until we're best friends.\n(groans)\nJess: Nick, can you believe it?\nYou're a bar owner.\nI'm so proud of you.\nNone of this would've happened without Schmidt standing up to his mom.\nIt was so scary.\nI can't believe I missed her.\nWe still can use the other 90% of the bar, right?\nYeah You know, that's not how it works.\nIt's just this is my favorite section. I wanted to...\nIt's a financial share.\nTo Schmidt's mom. I do want to have sex with her.\n(Shouting) Nick.\n"}, {"title": "04x20 - Par 5.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nOkay, Schmidt, you ready for your feedback for the week?\nYes. Uh, let me just pull up my performance grid.\nFirst off, thanks for keeping sex quick.\nYou were like a dog with an ice cream cone, and I loved it, but screaming \"that's how Schmidty do\" was not ideal.\nEven though that's how Sch-Schmidty did?\nWell, Schmidty did, and he did it good, but mommy doesn't want to hear how Schmidty's doing.\nNote... note taken.\nOkay. Great. Good.\nNote taken.\nI feel like I'm watching a p0rn set in an HR department.\nYou know, Fawn is teaching me how to be the most effective and successful man and lover I possibly can be.\nReally? I thought you were fine before.\nWhen you two were together? Which time?\nThe... the first time or the third time?\nBecause... 'cause you two were very off-and-on.\nIn a... in a very confusing way.\n(laughs) I've had sex with him so many times.\nWe have a fun thing together, don't we?\nSuper fun, yeah. I really enjoy it.\nWhat is her... what is it, Cecil?\nWhat is your name?\nYou'll learn it. Don't worry.\nFawn's helping me see that I haven't reached my full potential yet.\nWell, obviously, none of you have.\nNo, I have. I'm a cop.\nAnd, as of yesterday, my mom no longer buys my plane tickets, so... (clicks tongue)\nYou need a ten-year plan.\nAre you in a relationship that's headed towards marriage?\nI am not currently, but I did go on a date with somebody named Charles last month.\nShe was a woman, but she was named after her uncle.\nWell, Winston has no game.\nDude took a girl to a cement plant.\nTo see how rocks were made.\nThat's not where rocks are made.\nAnd she loved it, then she abruptly moved away.\n(groans)\nWork sucked, my friends.\n(nasally voice): Hear ye, hear ye.\nMilady.\nI dub you Sir Winston of the Roll of Egg.\n(nasally): Ah, yes. Yes.\nWho are you in this story?\nI'm the jester.\nI'm not gonna eat here anymore.\nYou'd think that the school board would want to give kids computers, but no, they just want to get reelected so they can keep dressing like Realtors from the 1980s.\nSolid municipal burn, Jessica.\nFawn... Councilwoman.\nCouncilwoman... do you think you could help me get some traction with these people?\nOh, funnily enough, I have a charity event tomorrow with other high-powered L.A. women.\nI'll put a word in with Yowtz.\nMartha Yowtz?\nYeah.\nThe lioness of Los Angeles education?\nYes.\nThe straw that stirs the school board's drink?\nThat's right.\nThat is a woman I'd like to get to know.\nIs there any way I could come with you to this event?\nAh, you know, it's really a networking thing.\nWell, that's perfect, 'cause I'd love to network her.\nWith her. It's \"with...\"\nYou network with her.\nYeah, it's \"network with her,\" and you don't really strike me as the \"networking\" type.\nYou're more of a \"follow a butterfly around for a day\" kind of gal.\nOh, sister, I'm a middle-school vice principal.\nYou think I got this job without knowing how to network?\nMost likely. Yes.\nI got an office with a door, bub.\nPencil me in. I'll yak with Yowtz.\nThe press will be there, and I could use a photo with an educator, so... okay.\nOh, great.\nOh. Hey.\nDo you still need me for the photo op?\nI will need you there, actually.\nI'm trying to become more accessible on social media.\nSpeaking of which, is there some way you can make your skin look less white in photos?\nPeople are saying that you're haunting me.\nI can do that. Absolutely. 100%.\nLet me just make a note.\nWonderful.\nAnd, Jess, the event tomorrow is at a golf course.\nDo you golf?\nDoes a bear eat with his hands? (chuckles)\nI don't know.\nI'll be there.\nGreat.\nSo I say to her, \"Water? I barely even know you.\"\nStop talking to me like we're in the middle of a conversation.\nWe just sat down.\nAll right.\nI hate when you do that.\nOkay.\nWinston.\nThat is a beautiful girl right there. Wow.\nJust say something to her.\nYeah, just say something to her.\nShawty, what that thang do?\nNo.\nWhat was that?\nWinston: Dude, I think it's a nervous tic that stems from my lack of self-confidence.\nWe got to help. I can't watch this.\nExcuse me, miss? Hi.\nCoach, stop.\nUm, this is my buddy, Winston.\nUm... I don't know what he's doing with his mouth.\nThat's not his normal smile at all.\nI'm gonna fix that.

Nice to... nice to meet you, KC.\nCece: Fawn is none of my business, and Schmidt seems to really like her, so whatever happens, I'm just not getting involved.\nThen why are you on your way to hang out with him?\nWhat are you doing?\nHe said to come over.\nHe said it was an emergency.\nWhat if he does something sexy?\nThat's like Gollum hanging out with the One Ring.\nIt'll be fine.\nOoh. Hey, Cece, I'm glad you're here.\nI need you to put bronzer all over my body.\nNone of the guys are here, and they also refused to do it.\nUm, all over.

Fawn's the man.\nOh, hey, there's Yowtz.\nWoman's got more connections than a flight from Burbank to Sri Lanka.\nWell, then, it's a good thing I bought the airport neck pillow in the gift shop, because... (chuckles)\nYou know what that means.\nI got this.\nOkay.\nHow the hell are you?\nJessica Day.\nI need 20 computers for my school.\nJust met you, but noted.\nYou're up.\nThanks.\nWhat? Oh.\nYou walk towards the...\nWhoops.\nOh, dear Lord.\nWhy are we putting this on your body?\nAren't you going to be wearing a shirt?\nWell, you know, Fawn wants me to be prepared for all scenarios.\nWhat if somebody gives birth out there and I have to swaddle the baby in my polo?\n(wry chuckle) Yeah...\nI've never been under this kind of scrutiny before.\nI'm having my teeth shaved by a 25th of an inch.\nFawn thinks that I have the teeth of an immigrant.\nShe says every time she looks at me, all she can see is Fievel Mouskewitz singing \"There Are No Cats in America.\"\nThose little... those little mice Jews.\nI mean, what do you think, Cece?\nYou... you like Fawn, right?\nYeah, I mean, as-as long as you're happy.\nThere you go.\nWhat the hell?\nWhat?\nWhy am I sparkly?\nSparkly?!\nYou bought the bronzer with glitter in it.\nCece, please, you gotta help me, Ce...\nFawn's gonna kill me!\nOkay, just don't get too pressive. You'll crease!\nSo stupid! I feel like I'm trying to get into an 18-and-under club in Tucson!\nSo, yeah, at the rally, the was this kid I know from the youth center who was arrested last week because he \"fit a description.\"\nI mean, he's 14... he doesn't even fit into his jeans.\n(uncomfortable laughter)\nYeah.\nAnyways... enough about me. Let's, uh, talk about you.\nWhat do you do?\nWhat do I do?\nUm... okay.\nWell... what do I do?\nUm...\nOkay, the truth is...\nHey, man.\nYou know them?\nOh, not personally, no.\nHey, what's up, Bishop?\nOh, yeah, I do know them.\nWe went to school together.\nSee you at work, bud.\nMore importantly... we work together.\nYou're a cop?\nMe? (laughs)\nA cop? No!\nNo, no, no, no, no, no. Don't...\nNo, no, no. Get that out of your head.\nUh, what I do is I'm a... male stripper.\nA stripper?\nThat's why they were wearing the uniforms.\nYeah, I see where you... why you would think that. No.\nA surprising amount of day work for a stripper.\nYou know, we just go in there, we do our routine while they eat their lunch salads.\nWow. (laughs)\nYou just pray nobody orders soup.\nLost a lot of good men to soup.\n(short laugh) It's hard to gauge temperature when you're just... dipping and running.\nYou'd be surprised what you could replace a ladle with.\nNice day.\nBeautiful.\nWhat happened to the top of my hat?\nYou take it?\n(laughs) A little, uh... little visor humor.\nGive me back my hat!\nI'm kidding. (chuckles)\nI wasn't gonna hit you.\nI'm just joshing.\nJust Joshua, Joshua, joshing...\nDo you ladies want to join my network?\nUh, you ladies can just go ahead and play through.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI'll catch up with you later.\nUh, so, how-how do you feel that the networking is going?\nPretty good.\nI would call it, like, a solid B.\nIt's a cruise ship disaster.\nLook, Jess, if you want those computers, we have a lot of work to do and not a lot of time to do it.\nShake my hand.\nGross.\nWhat is your name?\nJess?\nYou have the confidence of a child that was raised in a basement.\nSay it with pride, and include your job title like it's the second half of your name.\nLike this... Fawn Moscato, City Council.\nJessica Day, Vice Principal!\nHow the heck are you?\nDawn: Lighten it up with a quick joke whenever possible.\nNice shoes.\nLook like you chopped off Big Bird's feet, you murderer. (laughs)\nFawn: And try not to make jokes about murdering\nSesame Street puppets if you can.\nJess: Good note.\nFawn:  Now, tell me...\nAre you wearing underwear?\nOh, yeah. Big-time.\nLose them. I never wear underwear in networking scenarios.\nGives you a secret; an edge.\nBesides, I firmly believe that power emanates from the vagina.\nSo, why block it?\nIt's not the only thing that emanates.\nWhat does that mean?\n(quietly): Other stuff.\n\n\n\nSo I said, \"Tammy, are we playing golf, or are we making sand castles?\"\n(laughter)\nTammy is the worst.\nShe told my kid to shut up once. I nearly punched her.\nI don't want to start talking business while we still have a whole tournament to play, but...\nI'd love to connect about your ideas in the clubhouse.\nLet's meet up there when we're all done.\nGreat. I'll see you in there, Marty.\nMay I call you Marty?\nOh, I'd prefer it.\n(laughs)\nThe clubhouse?\nThat is where you close the deal.\nYou are in, my friend.\nNow, let's finish up this game.\nNo problem.\nWrite a six and let's go. They should start putting GPS in golf balls, am I right?\nWe already got lapped by Sue Kim from the Korean Women's League, and she's 100.\nJess, she is literally 100 years old.\nAnd I'm... I'll tell you what...\nNot a young 100.\nMartha doesn't strike me as the type of person who gives computers to cheaters.\nYou really don't understand how networking works.\nThe computers are just the thing you talk about when you're really talking about how to help each other become more powerful.\nJust like the money for this golf thing... it doesn't go to charity. It just pays for the event where we network.\nIsn't that cool?\nYay, America.\nWere the computers ever really on the table?\nYou're still talking about the computers?\nOkay. Uh, no. No. No money for computers.\nI should've never listened to you. I also should have never removed my underwear, because now it's drafty and I feel vulnerable to wildlife.\nAre your underwear sticking out of your pocket?\nAre those boys' underwear?\nThey're unisex. None of your business.\nLook, will you forget the ball? Or none of these women are ever going to invite you to play golf again.\nWell, I don't want to play golf with these women again.\nI don't want any part of this.\nIf I can't have the computers, I will... I will stay here and I will play a clean game of golf.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, Fawn, I need to go find my ball.\nLike an honest person.\nOkay.\nOh, look... it's a baby bird.\nNo, it's a dead baby bird.\nI need to move on before I get emotional.\nCan't believe I didn't tell her I was a cop.\nWith everything that's been going on, I just...\nI feel like she wouldn't respect me.\nYou want to know what I think?\nNo, Nick, I don't.\nThis is something you can't understand.\nBecause I'm not black?\nUh...\nWhat, because I don't work for NASA, I can't fix a rocket ship?\nIf you don't work at NASA, they're not gonna just let you walk off the street and fix a rocket ship.\nYou're missing my point.\nBesides, you lost your right to talk to me about race during the O.J. trial.\nIs in the white Bronco...\nWhy does it have to be a \"white\" Bronco?\nWhy not just a Bronco?\nI can talk to you about this.\nI mean, we grew up together.\nWe went to the same schools, we watched the same shows, we listened to the same records.\nYour mother got a mouth on the back of her neck, and bitch chew like this. (grunts, laughs)\nHercules.\nWas that your Eddie Murphy?\nThat's Eddie Murphy.\nThat was so bad, it wasn't even offensive.\nI said \"Hercules,\" and everyone associates that with Eddie Murphy.\nWhenever you do your impressions, it makes me super uncomfortable.\nFine. You know what? You want to do this?\nYou and me are gonna get weird about race?\nDo your Seinfeld.\nCome... Nick, that's not...\nDo your Seinfeld.\nWhat's the deal with bananas?\nI mean, they got orange juice, you got apple juice, where's the banana juice?\n(laughs): I never thought of that.\nAh, boy.\n'Cause you got orange juice, you...\nI love you, but you're white, I'm black.\nI understand where she's coming from.\nWhen I was a kid, we used to run from the police.\nEven if we did nothing wrong, it was just out of habit.\nWhy haven't you ever told me?\nCoach: 'Cause you'll never get it.\nHow long have you been standing there?\nUh, right around, \"Your mama got a mouth on the back of her neck, and the bitch chew like this.\"\nNow, that's Eddie!\nI don't see the difference.\n(laughs): Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!\nHe's doing the laugh!\nThat's what I was doing.\n(imitating Eddie Murphy's laugh)\nStop, Nick.\nI honestly don't see the difference.\nAs the only other black man in this loft, I feel like I should weigh in.\nThis issue really hits home with me, and I feel like I have a lot of thoughts and ideas that I need to get off my chest.\nThank you, Coach.\nBut I'm hungry.\nMan.\nI skipped breakfast, and lunch is gonna be dumb as hell.\n Race talk snacks \n Race talk snacks, gotta get me \n Some race talk snacks \n Gonna be super uncomfortable! \nSo, KC...\nShh...\nI just feel like...\nCan't-can't weigh in.\nI know, but I...\nCan't weigh in.\nI do have something I want to say that's not a race...\nShh, don't.\nI know what I'm gonna do.\nI'm gonna tell her the truth.\nI'm a good guy; that's all that matters.\nThat's what I was gonna say.\nI want to make this... No, no, no.\nShut it down, Nick.\nYour mother got a mouth on the back of her neck, and she chews like this.\nMurphy, Murphy, Murphy.\nSo the good news is you can't see the glitter anymore. Great.\nWell, what's the bad news?\nYou look like, um... can't exactly put my finger on it.\nI look like the dead body the police pull out of a lake.\nThat's how you describe it; you look dead.\nI don't want to look like a dead boy.\nI want to look like a living boy.\nWhy are you calling yourself a boy?\nBecause I'm freaking out!\n(phone vibrating) Freaking...\nFreaking out. Oh, no.\nIt's-it's Fawn.\n(sighs)\nHey, Faw... hey, Fawn.\nWhat the Jewish God did you do?\nIn an attempt to look less ghost-like, I put on some bronzer, but the bronzer had glitter in it, and now...\nYou look like a wood carving of yourself.\nThe press is here.\nAnd single women have proven to be less appealing to voters.\nFix it and get here now.\nI am Fawn Moscato, and I will not miss a photo opportunity!\nFaw... Oh.\nFawn?\nHow about a fake beard?\nGet some double-sided tape, we can shave Winston's cat...\nOkay, you know what, enough.\nI cannot just stand here and watch Fawn treat you like she's your pageant mom.\nShe needs to accept you exactly how you are, or you need to find somebody that will.\n'Cause I think you are fine as is.\nDamn it.\nYou know what, you're right. I'm gonna go talk to her.\nCan you drive though? I want to fix my makeup in the car.\nFor me, not for her.\nI don't want to scare anybody. Ugh.\nI think I'm drunk from my face fumes.\nI've never seen so many strokes taken on a single hole in all of my life.\nThis has got to be some kind of record.\nDo you care to comment?\nHey!\nNot bad! Look at her go!\nThe hole's behind you.\nThanks, Marty.\n172!\nPar was five.\nI know, Marty.\nYou're the worst golfer I've ever seen.\nLook, I don't care if I look stupid.\nI didn't come here to climb the ladder.\nThe only reason why I came here was to get computers for my students.\nAnd that's the only reason why I came: for the school.\nI respect that.\nI'll get you those computers.\nReally?!\nYes, I will.\nIn 2018, when the district is fiscally solvent.\nI'll... take that as a victory.\nI support Vice Principal Day.\nIt is education that will bring water back to this city and will rebuild the middle class...\nDon't let me back down.\nDon't worry, I will not.\nYou look... so crazy right now.\nYou look like a doll boy.\nA doll man.\nI'm a d... I'm a doll man.\nA doll man who's about to get his dignity back.\nLet's beat China!\nI'm Fawn Moscato!

What's going on?\nYou're not wearing any, uh...\nEach one's like a snowflake.\nWhat do you mean there's a meme?\nIt speaks?\nWell, what does it say?\nOh, well, that is just crass.\nYes, I know I wanted a more accessible Web pr...\nWill you stop laughing, Lou?\nYou're a father!\nYou're my father!\n(gasps)\nOh, no, no, it's... it's carpet cleaner.\nYou know, I thought I'd take it right down to the base.\nI'll probably have to regrow some skin, but it's all right.\nIt's okay, Schmidt.\nLook, I understand if you want to break up with me.\nI'm a laughingstock, and you shouldn't be associated with my brand.\nWhich is tainted.\nAn unfortunate choice of words.\nSo, what was it you wanted to say to me?\nFawn, I don't want to break up with you.\nI like you just the way that you are.\nNo offense, but you're terrifying to look at, and you smell like a chemical fire.\nTaint that the truth?\nYeah.\nDid you see what I did there?\nI just...'Cause you did it, then I...\nIt was too... too soon. It's too soon.\nI wanted you to feel good about when you said it though.\nOkay.\nKC?\nSo... um... this is the real me.\nI'm proud of what I do, I really am.\nI work with a lot of great people, and I want to be one of them.\nPlus, if there are ever Ghostbusters, I know they're gonna recruit from law enforcement first.\nI know you're mad at me.\nI just came to say that.\nI'm not mad that you're a cop.\nI'm mad that you lied.\nWell, tell you what, uh, is there any way I could take you out again and, you know, uh, be so honest with you that it scares the hell out of you?\nI don't know.\nThat uniform is kind of distracting, isn't it?\nMaybe you should... take it off.\n(laughs)\nYou lied and said you were a stripper; it seems like the fair thing to do.\n(dance music playing)\nJust in front of all these people?\nIn front of your colleagues? (man whoops)\nOh, okay. I hear some \"whoos!\"\n(whoops)\nYou ain't got no Ginuwine or nothing?\nSeriously though, I'm...\nI'm... I really am a police officer.\nI can't really be here stripping for you...\nIt's a clip-on ladies.\nAnd it's on the ground.\nHere we go.

I might just be... an expert in love. Like a... you know, like a love doctor, if you will.\nI will not.

I want to party!\n(laughs) Yeah!\n(indistinct cheering)\nI'm gonna do this and gonna do this, this, this, this, this.\n(sighs)\nWhat was that speech?\nI'm sorry, okay? I told you to read the statement beforehand and then you told me that terrifying story about doing improv at a fat person's camp.\nI didn't know that the statement was gonna blame me for Panty-Gate.\nAnd by the way, for your information, the Belly Laughs did not \"do\" improv. We reinvented it.\nI know you must be embarrassed, but... you saved me.\nYeah, well, people think I'm a sicko now.\nOne of your aides spit at me.\nWas it Shallon? Yeah, that's a lisp, but still, he's fired.

I can't sit here and watch Schmidt with Fawn.\nAnd I don't think they're breaking up any time soon, so...\nCece, they're never gonna last. He doesn't really love her.\nDid he tell you that?\nNo, but... as a doctor of love, I sense these things.\n(knocking)\nThe Love Doctor just knows.\nMay.\nHi.\nUh, I'm here for my endpin anchor.\nYeah.\nAh, thank you.\nVery sorry to hear about the breakup. Are you okay?\nUm, yeah. Yeah.\nI'm here to talk if you ever need to. In hard times, it's nice to have a friend, May.\nThanks... Jess.\nRight?\nYes.\nWell, uh...\nI'm in the middle of a recording session.\nI got to get back to the studio, so... see ya.\nBye.\nYeah, Jess, she looks real broken up about it.\n\n\n\n(knocking)\nI... I'm a mess.\nI know!\n(crying)\n(whispers): The doctor is in.\nWait, what?\nNothing. Cry it out.\nMmm! Ah.\nWow.\nI have never seen Coach go this hard after a breakup, man.\nYou sure he's okay?\nIt's good, it's good, it's good.\nYou treat an outside wound with rubbing alcohol, you treat an inside wound with drinking alcohol.\nThat's science.\nI feel that, man.\nIt is time to turn things up.\nSidney...\nDo what you do! (chuckles)\n(\"Black Velvet\" by Alannah Myles begins playing)\nAw... (short chuckle)\nThis is my jam.\nY: We've only been dating for a few months.

I can't understand anything you're saying with the crackers.\nDo you love him?\nI think I do.\nWell, then, maybe moving to New York doesn't mean you have to break up.\n(muffled): So you think that I should... that I should ask Coach to move with me?\nOkay, how about we put down the crackers?\nI think she wants Coach to move to New York with her.\nOh! Yes, yes!\nI mean...\nYeah? You-You... You think that he would say yeah?\nYeah. Definitely. He's crazy about you. He had a meltdown today in health class.\nNow, the kids did learn that sex is emotionally complicated, so it was a good class, but trust me...\nWhat Jess is trying to say here is that if you... if you really know how you feel about someone, you need to act now.\nWow. (laughs) Am I really doing this?\nYeah, but not before we clean your face,\n'cause it's caked in snot.\nWinston: Ooh, yeah, Coach!\nWho you think he's gonna hook up with?\nIt's a tough Monday crowd. It...\nIt's nearly impossible to say, but I'm gonna go with the white bodysuit and, uh, the leopard print leggings.\nShe looks smart to me.\nWinston: No way. No way. money's on the one with the wedding ring whose husband is clearly over there in the corner spying on her.\nYeah, he's not happy about that.\nOh, oh, ooh!

Ote.\n(chuckles) Dr. Idiot.\nYeah, I get it. I just never understood the whole love doctor thing, anyway.\nI guess I was just hoping that with all the mistakes I've made, at least I could help you guys find love.\nThat I didn't go through all that for no reason.\nYeah, but no one has the answers, you know?\nIt's love, it makes no sense. It's messy.\nThere's no such thing as a love doctor.\nYou know what, Cece?\nGo on your trip. Go get over Schmidt.\nDon't listen to me.\nI'm gonna climb that mountain.\nYeah, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.\nBut I'm not gonna do it for Schmidt, I'm gonna do it for me.\nGood. Go.\nI love you, girl.\nLove you, too.\nHey, don't smile. Don't smile. Look sadder that you're buying underpants. Underpants make you very, very sad.\nOh, I hate being here so much.\nThese underpants make me so uncomfortable.\nThat's perfect. There's that fat boy improv training.\nNow, next, I'm going to ask for something with a little more coverage. You're gonna flip out, say you can't take it anymore, and leave the store. Then tomorrow we enter you into some kind of rehab facility.\nWhen you get out we'll announce that we're getting married.\nMarried? What? I don't...\nShh. Yes. Shh. Yes, yes. Okay, so what I say is we build on this momentum, okay?\nAnd we get married. I know it's not the most romantic idea in the world, but we'd be happy.\nAnd then, we play our cards right, you and I are living in the mayor's mansion by 2020.\nFawn. Fawn.\nNo.\nNo? Oh, n-no to some of it?\nNo to all of it. We can't get married. I barely even know you.\nYou... You know me.\nThe real you, Fawn.\nThis is the real me.\nI'm a politician, not in The vagina Monologues.\nI mean, what do you want?\nI can get you anything you want.\nYou'll be rich, I'll be powerful.\nI'm realizing... just now that it's not what I want.\nI don't want any of that.\nI want to be in love.\nI want to be... I want to be crazy in love.\nOkay, well, certainly don't quote Beyonc\u00e9 and then pretend like you just thought of it.\nUh, uh, I want to be drunk in love.\nBut that's also a Beyonc\u00e9 lyric.\nCome on, Fawn.\nYou're not really in love with me.\nI'm not really in love with-with you.\nWe just look great together buying underpants.\nAre you breaking up with me?\nI guess I kind of am.\nWell, um...\nI don't want this to come out the wrong way, but... does this mean I lose your vote?\n(chuckles)\nNever.\n(camera shutters clicking)\n(shouting): I just can't stand to be in here any longer!\nSurrounded... by these underpants!\nRed ones and yellow ones and blue ones and pink ones!\nAnd this woman with her brassiere/teddy.\nUnderpants everywhere! They're driving me nuts!\nI feel like I got underpants all over my body!\nSchmidt out. This is ridiculous.\nEnough is enough. Get out of here, paparazzi.\nNo, leave me... Get-get out of my way, sir.\nI just want to say something.\nNo.\nAnd then I'll leave.\nLook, I'll never get involved in your personal life ever again.\nOkay? Because I have no idea what I'm talking about.\nAnd I know that now.\nYou could just... you could just troll for basic bitches at the juice bar, and I will say, mm, nothing.\nOkay? So, look, I was wrong, and I'm sorry.\nI do love her.\nI'm crazy about her.\nYes! I was right!\n(laughs) Love Doctor! I'm back.\nReally? I thought it was just a regular break-up.\nBut in all fairness, I hadn't thought about it that hard.\nI mean, what do I do, man?\nYou know, it's like she's going to New York.\nYup.\nI can't go to New York with her. That's crazy.\nYou know? I like my sun on the right and my ocean on the left.\nIt's a rule of mine.\nPlus, I'd have to leave you guys.\nCan't leave you guys, I mean, I finally have a home.\nAll right, flash forward to the future.\n40, 50 years.\nYou're married. Kids, grandkids.\nMm-hmm.\nI'm long dead.\nNaturally.\nOf course.\nAnd you look over to the woman sitting next to you.\nAnd she's gray.\nShe's old.\nShe has that, like, grandma smell.\nYou have a grandpa smell, but you got...\nGrandmas always smell like... like right when you open a cupboard.\nYeah, she has that smell, but...\nMm-hmm.\nYou love her.\nBe honest with yourself.\nIs that fat old lady sitting beside you...\nMm...\nHonestly, right now, in my head, I'm just picturing, like, a beanbag chair with a wig on it.\nOkay. We have gone too much into the description.\nOkay.\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nIs that May?\nI think so.\nWell, that's big.\nLet's go get her.\nYeah?\nYeah.\nWhoo-hoo!\nLet's go get May. - Yeah.\nHey, Jess, she texted me back!

I can't stay here.\nI don't want you to stay here.\nUm... look, I know we haven't been dating that long, and, um, this might seem crazy, but I was won...\nWill you move to New York with me?\nYes! That! That's what I...\nYes?!\nYeah, that's what I wanted to do, yeah.\n(screeches) Right. So, we're moving to New York?\nWe're moving to New York.\nWe're moving to New York.\nJersey City.\nWhat?\nJersey City!\nJersey... I don't...\nNick: Well, this is all you, Jess.\nCome on.

I know you guys didn't like her.\nHated her guts.\nSo much...\nWait. What are we watching right now?\nThat girl just *** her boobs out Nick, why are you watching smut?\nIt was right there in the DVD player. I don't wanna get up and get it.\n***\nWho leaves p0rn on the DVD player.\nI don't think we'll use it ***. Might as well just leave it in.\nI'm sleeping on the couch.

What a joke.\nMore like Butt Strat. This place is total butt.\nHey, Jess, it's our sex mug.\nWhat?\nWhat?\nOh... nothing.\nIt's just a mug that Nick and I used for sex.\nOh, gross. Like, in it?\nEw! What?\nNo. No, we used it when we were dating.\nIt was hard to find times to be intimate with everyone around, so we needed to come up with a code.\nJust a way to let each other know we were aroused without arousing suspicion.\nThat's wordplay.\nIt's also a free writing lesson.\nJess: When one of us left the mug on the entryway table...\nAss out meant it was time to...\nMake love...\nBone.\nYeah, make love.\nWe're getting rid of this thing... especially since you guys aren't using it anymore, right?\nNick and jess: Right.\nWrong.\nI, Winston L'Andre Bishop, saw that very mug on this very hallway table just last week...\nAss very out.\nOoh...!\nJess: Winston, that mug hasn't seen any action in over a year.\nYou're off your rocker.\nIf I were off my rocker, would I take a weekly selfie with my cat?\nOh, Winston.\nYou see, just last week, I took this selfie with...\n(chuckling): Wait, not that one.\n(Winston laughing)\nThat's crazy.

Clean break. I agree.\nJess, hold on. Hey, hey... H-How is that...?\nJess, wait!\nYeah, I'm stuck.\nWell, we seem to be in a bit of a conundrum.\nHow do I know this is your box?\nDo you have any identification, Cece?\nCece's my ex-girlfriend; it's a box of her things.\nBut I can tell you everything that's in there.\nThere's some paintings, erotic writings, there's a brassiere.\nWhy would you have her brassiere?\nWell, you know, she left it in my car, and I kept it.\nShe never asked for it back?\nOkay, um, Wally, look, it's a box of memories.\nMemories that I'm not ready to let go of yet.\nMaybe if I could talk to Cece...\nCan't talk to Cece; Cece's on top of a mountain.\nLook, I know this is unusual, but I need that box back, Wally.\nI need it back more than anything else I've ever needed in my life.\nPlease.\nDoes she know she's on the mountain, or is she being held there against her will?\nDamn it, Wally, give me the box!\nNo! No!\nNo! No!\n(whistle blowing)\nWally!\nStop blowing the whistle!\nYou're sexually safe!\nCoach, is that a bigger bag?\nMy old bag broke, so I got a wheelie.\nSame system.\nStill only essentials.\n(pan clangs)\nIs there a pan in there?\nNah. Nah, that's not a pan.\nThat was just, uh, the sound of two track pants hitting together.\nYou know, the buttons be like... ting... ti...\nBut, um... (clears throat)\nYeah, since I got this new suitcase, I might as well take a few more things.\nJust to fill up space. Know what I mean?\nJust to fill up space.\nLike, uh... take these glass grapes.\nJust to fill up space.\nNot that I want them.\nOf course not.\nAnd this blanket.\nFor cushioning.\n(moans)\nThat smells nice, huh?\nFor cushioning, dude.\nThese mystery novels.\nTake these.\nNot 'cause they're Jess's, just because...\nI'm an avid reader now.\nStop smiling at me, man.\nI'm taking Nick's workout jams.\n'Cause, uh... that one time I trained him, (voice breaking): saw a lot of results.\n(voice breaking): I remember. He was so fat.\nAnd I'm taking this remote.\nBecause you always hit the info button by mistake.\nNo, no, it's not by mistake, Coach.\n(sobbing softly)\nI like to know more about the cast and crew.\nRemote's gonna miss this TV so much.\nOur TV is gonna miss that remote.\n(sobs)\n(sniffs)\nSmells like all our fingers.\n(both sobbing)\n(wailing)\nHey, Jess.\nHey.\nDo you really think I haven't thought about putting this mug out?\nOh, I don't know, Nick. You said it.\nWhat's past is past. Clean break.\nThink about my living conditions for the past year.\nI live across the hall from my beautiful ex-girlfriend.\nAnd your living conditions... you live across the hall from your beautiful ex-boyfriend.\nTwo true beauties.\nSo you have thought about it.\nI'm a man.\nI am a human man.\nInteresting.\nYou're the one who's always getting out of that shower in that little towel, Jess.\nOr you're wearing your glitter or your pantyhose.\nThey're driving me crazy! Okay?\nI know how hard it is to get those pantyhose up, and I just... I just sometimes want to rip 'em down.\nJust admit it, Miller!\nYou're thinking about putting the mug down right now!\nNo.\nAdmit that you want me to be thinking about it.\nI don't want you to think about it, so stop thinking about it.\nWell stop talking about it and then I'll stop thinking about it.\nSo, you are thinking about it?\nLook, Jess!\nI'm not not... thinking about it.\n(door opens)\nHey, guys.

(groans)\nBut I can't tell you.\n(groans) So, I'll...\nI'll tell you.

Of course I'll be your best man!\nAll right!\nThese rings are the first of a dozen accessories that are gonna unify the bridal party.\nAs you can see from my preliminary vision board, our wedding will borrow equally from the holy trinity of Liz Taylor, Jackie O and The Power Gays.\nOh, I'm scared.\nYou should be.\nGuys, look at us.\nA year ago, we were spinning around like cows in the movie Twister.\nNow look at us. You guys are engaged.\nYou're a minority owner of the bar.\nI'm the maid of honor who's made of honor.\nThat joke works better on paper.\nYeah, probably.\nAnd this guy... is the cop who freaking saved a freaking kid's life.\nHelp!\nI'm stuck!\nHey!\n(grunting)\nHelp!\n(shouts)\n(panting)\nThanks, Officer.\nCall an ambulance.\nI feel fine.\nFor me!\n(chuckles) You know, Channel 4 is calling me the Carport Hero.\nI just... I just really hope it sticks.\nIt's not a big deal.\nThis is... our year.\nThe Chinese zodiac says it's the Year of the Monkey.\nI say it's the Year of...\n Us... \n(grunts)  It's the Year... \n Of Us... \n It's the Year \n Of Us... \n Us... \n<i>Schmidt: Thanks so much for your help, Jess.</i>\n(chuckles)\nCece has zero idea that you're flying her mother in for the engagement party tonight.\nShe is... she is alarmingly in the dark.\nMaybe it's a cultural thing.\nYou know, we saw the British coming. India did not.\nAre you nervous to meet Cece's mom?\nNo. Cece said her mom is really excited that her sexy little bronco has finally met a cowboy that can tame her.\nParaphrasing. And I'm really excited to meet the woman that Cece came out of.\nNot paraphrasing.\nI like your confidence.\nMeeting Big Mama P is huge.\nHer approval means everything to Cece.\nMom, this is my new friend, Jess.\n20-minute playdate.\n(both squealing)\nSecretly, she's a romantic, 'cause she used to be a Bollywood dancer and Mr. P's parents forbid them from marrying.\nHot. Continue.\nWhen they saw her perform, they were so moved, they gave their blessing.\nDance can be so powerful sometimes.\nUgh, don't I know it.\nThat's why I booked L.A.'s premier Bollywood dance troupe, MaHotMoves Gandhi.\nMaHotMoves Gandhi.\nShe's gonna love you. I gotcha.\nOkay. I'm gonna go check on the best man.\nI'm sure he's handling whatever task you gave him just fine.\n(both laugh)\nHe's so bad at everything!\nLook, he's just one of those rare heterosexual men who does not have a knack for wedding planning.\nI'll never understand men like that.\nI can't pick up Cece's mom from the airport!\nIt's too much pressure.\nYou said I only had to do the easy best man stuff.\nYou're picking someone up from the airport in a car.\nNot outer space in a canoe. It is easy, Nick.\nThen why don't you do it?\nI can't pick her up.\nTonight is one of the most important nights of my hair's life, and I need a shampoo.\nNot a cut. They'll try and cut it, but I won't let them.\nGetting a day-of cut would be insane.\nUnless, of course, Julian's working. (sighs)\nJulian won't be working though.\nYou keep fireworks in your car?\nWhat are you, a little Chinese boy?\nHey, you guys! Just saying hey!\n He's your carport hero, baby \n Carport hero, baby \n He can take away your pain \n Stand by you forever \n He can take \n Your breath away. \nStop treating me like this, okay? I'm no different from anyone else.\n(horn honks) Officer Bishop, it is an honor to live in your building, sir.\n(horn honks fanfare)\nThat's Glen, too, man. Glen hates everybody.\nGlen flips off kids.\nWinston: Guys, look, quit it, okay?\nEver since I became the Carport Hero, you're treating me like I'm special, and I'm not.\nIt's me. Winnie the Bish! The Bish with the wish!\nAnd my wish is to have fun!\nWhich is exactly why I'm not gonna confiscate the fireworks behind your back.\nYeah, you got me, Officer Bishop.\nYou can have it.\nI also want you to have this Jesus wig.\nYou know, wigs aren't illegal.\nI know.\nBut I think it would look awesome on you.\nSo do I.\nPut it on.\nFine.\nWhoa. Whoa!\nWhoa. Whoa!\nBeautiful!\nWinston, you look so handsome.\nOh, my God.\nIt looks even better than I thought.\nMan (over P.A.): Flight 262 from Mumbai, your luggage is now arriving at baggage claim 2.\n(upbeat Indian music playing)\n(music ends)\nYes! Yes!\nTake five.\nHey.\nHey.\nHey, hey.\nSo, I just got a voice mail from my mom, 'cause she is at the airport.\nDid you... did you fly her in for the party?\nYes.\nYeah, I did. It was supposed to be a surprise, but...\nAre you so happy? Oh, excuse me. (phone rings)\nOh, it's just... um...\nHey, Nick.\nNick: Hey, Jess.\nGuess who did it. Me.\nI got Cece's mom. I was even on time.\nOh, she's there. Put her on.\nReally? You can speak with her? How?\nWhat are you talking about?\nNo, Jess, I-I need to talk to you now.\nUm, okay. I got to go.\nJess says hi!\nDo you prefer the windows down or the AC?\nWow, you look just like Cece!\n(speaking Hindi)\nYeah.\nIt's amazing, yeah. I own it myself.\nMan (over P.A.): White zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.\n(groaning)\nWhat is going on?\nWhatever it is, it can't be that bad.\nJess, I haven't told my mom that I'm getting married.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nIt's gonna be fine, 'cause...\nI'm your maid of honor, and I will be there with you tonight every step of the way.\n 'Cause this is the Year of, of... \nOh!\nOh, my God!\n(screaming, grunting) Oh, Jess! Oh! Oh!\n(gasps)\n(grunting continues)\nI'm fine.\nDon't worry about me. The doctor said I'll be good as new in no time.\nI know I don't look like somebody who should be questioning somebody else's judgment, but... maybe you should have told your mom you were getting married.\nI know. I'm just so worried that she is not gonna like Schmidt.\nAnd then she won't give us her blessing... which would kill me.\nOh, she'll love him when she meets him.\nSchmidt is not exactly what my mom had imagined for me.\nYou know, she wanted someone maybe not so... white?\n(laughs): Oh, he is so white.\nRemember when the power went out, and we put him in the window to keep the planes away?\nWhat is Schmidt gonna think when he finds out?\nWe are gonna get her blessing, or I'm not your maid of H.\nThose stairs may have broken my body, but they did not break my spirit.\nAnd with that, I rise.\nHoney, you're not... You just need to... Yeah, relax. Okay.\nYou definitely can't go to this party.\n(sighs) I got to go and tell him.\nI got to go tell him before she gets there.\nI'll call Nick, and I'll have him stall her.\nOkay.\nI don't think I can. You have no idea how anxious this woman is to get to the party.\nNo, no, no, I told you, we're not there yet.\nYou got to stay plugged in.\nYou're such a pill.\nWell, just take her to the mall, get her some soft serve.\nBe sure to save your receipts. I'll reimburse you from the party fund.\nGot to go.\nMrs. Parikh, can you keep a secret?\nI'm going to kill this soft serve nonsense.\n(whimpers) You know what we're gonna do?\nWe're gonna play laser tag! (screaming)\n(shouting in Hindi) What are you doing?!\nWe're gonna play laser tag!\nIt's a fun American game! It's a fun game!\nBoth: Groomsmen! Yeah. (whoops)\n\n\n\nMmm.\nAh. Love each and every one of you sons of bitches.\nNow, who are you? I'm Groomsman Number Two.\n(chuckles) Big Schmidt, Schmidt's cousin.\nI'm Robby, Groomsman Number Four.\nI am the ex-boyfriend of the bride, and a weirdly close friend of the groom.\nI'm Number Five, J.

(men laughing)\nThank you for your time. Thank you for your time.\nI have a brief statement from G3, who could not make it here tonight.\nIt says, \"Dear Jess, I can't fly in for every damn party.\n\"I will see you at... (imitates Coach): the wedding.\"\nIf you know Coach, that's exactly how he...\n\"Wedding.\"\nYeah, yeah.\nAnd then he always goes, \"Coach.\"\n(laughs)\nNow, me, myself, I am Winston Bishop.\nOfficer Winston Bishop?\nThe Winston Bishop? The Carport Hero?\nI knew it was you. I saw you on TV, man.\nOfficer, you make me want to be a better man.\nI'm gonna stop, uh, peeing in my ex-wife's mailbox.\nWinston: No, seriously, everybody, calm down.\nAct normal around me.\nI'm a fun guy. I do pranks.\nUh, Cece's last wedding? The badger that fell down and almost killed a bunch of people... that was me!\n(chuckles)\nI'm Prank Sinatra, baby!\nOld Brown Eyes.\nAin't no prank like a badger prank, because a badger prank got badgers, and it's dangerous as hell!\nMs. Parikh.\nWho are you?\nOh. My goodness. Of course.\nI must be completely unrecognizable to you from the countless photos you must have seen.\nIn honor of your visit, I stood the humble recipient of a professional shampoo.\nSo you're the man who's marrying my daughter?\nSure am.\nNo wonder she didn't tell me that she was engaged.\nOh.\nOh, no, then.\nI'm assuming she was afraid I would disapprove.\nBut now that you've met me...\nI disapprove.\nStrong disapprove.\nLet's take a moment to applaud your daughter's instincts.\nNo, no, no. Look, Schmidt. Mom.\nI'm sorry. I can explain everything.\nPresenting...\nCece's mom!

Oh, thank God!\nI need your help.\nHey, Jess, let me ask you something.\nUh, I'm a fun guy, right? I mean, I have a way about me.\nWinston, look at me, look around.\nDoes your thing seem important now?\nYou're the Carport Hero. Now I need your help.\nNo more Carport Hero!\nTonight, I'm Prank Sinatra.\nNo. No! You didn't play a prank...\nYou are the worst prankster in the world!\nEvery prank you do turns out either too big...\nWhat is it?\nDid you register me as a sex offender? (snickers) or too small.\nHow'd this blueberry get in here?\n(mumbles): I don't...\n(laughs)\n(whoops)\nYou should have saw your face!\nHe did not see that coming.\nJust like no one's gonna see what's coming tonight.\nNothing should be coming tonight.\nI'm sorry, Jess.\nThe fuse has already been lit.\nThe lion has spotted the gazelle.\nThe doo-doo is already mid-flight to the fan.\nThe silly hounds have been released.\nI repeat: the silly hounds have been released.\nWhat did you d...

I'm sorry I screwed up my easy job.\n(speaking Hindi angrily)\nAnd stop being so mean to me, or I swear to God I'm gonna fall in love with you!\n(speaking Hindi angrily)\nWhere you going? Come back.\n(sighs)\nLet me make it up to you.\nI know that I said I wanted the easy job.\nBut screw that.\nI'm the best man, Schmidty.\nI want the hard jobs.\nI can handle it.\nSo what do we got? What do we need?\nWe're past hard at this point.\nWe're well into impossible.\nIt's an unfixable situa...\n(horn honks fanfare)\nSchmidt, I did not just drive 15 miles on a gout throne to watch you give up.\nEspecially not...\n In the Year... of Us. \nLook at yourself.\nLook around us.\nMaybe this isn't our year.\nI have a plan.\nAnd whatever it is, I'm in. I got this guy's back.\nDon't think we actually need...\nI know, but I'm in, is what I'm saying.\nThat... I mean...\n Whatever it is, I want in. \nOkay, whatever.\nI want in.\nSchmidt, how important is this to you?\nHave I made that clear?\nThat I want to be, like, a third.\nYou can be in. You're in.\nYou're in.\nThanks.\nThat's all I wanted her to say.\nAre you willing to do whatever it takes?\nOf course.\nI also didn't love the tone that, like, \"I'm in, but who cares that I'm in?\"\nJess (over speakers): Ladies and gentlemen, could I have your attention please?\nHello.\nI'm Jessica Day.\nI'm the maid of honor, but when I fell down the stairs, I wished I was made of rubber.\n(laughs)\n(man coughing quietly)\nUh...\nThis one goes out to the secret romantic in the audience.\nJust a little reminder that love...\n(chuckles) conquers all.\nAnd without further ado, MaHotMoves Gandhi.\nFollow me, follow me.\nFollow me!\n(upbeat Indian music playing)\n(upbeat Indian music continues)\nThink they're all really friends?\nYou know, I mean, when the dancing day is done?\n(crowd cheering)\n(upbeat Indian music continues)\n(crowd laughing, cheering)\n(upbeat Indian music continues)\n(music ends, crowd cheering)\n(whoops)\n(Jess laughs)\nHey.\nThat was great.\nFantastic.\nWonderful.\nJess: Where'd she go?\nJess: Mrs. Parikh?

I love all parts of pizzas, especially the dough.\nOnce I asked for a ball of dough, and they gave it to me and I took it to a park and ate it.\nI'm so glad you opened up.\nBut then I realized I needed some sauce...\n(laughter)\nPeople always make fun of my eyes, but I guess they're...\nOh-ho! Good!\nWinston, can I have a moment?\n(quietly): Uh, yeah.\nI love Flip and Nan.\nI hate Fred.\nNo!\nI know!\nSo Fred's not shy, he just sucks.\nWhen I asked him what his favorite hobby was, he said, \"Towels.\"\nI've got to break up with that human pile of saltine dust.\nI love Flip! I mean, Flip taught me how to be vulnerable with KC, you know?\nYeah.\nNancy ear-candled me.\nI can hear for miles.\nTheir relationship's just such an inspiration, and I want to be around it, but what can we do?\nWe ditch Fred. Forget about that dude.\nWe establish our own relationships with Flip and Nancy.\nBoom! Make future plans with just them.\n\"Future plans\" is redundant, but other than that, I am on board!\nOkay.\nNow, I'm gonna need some alone time with Flip and Nancy.\nCan you stall Fred?\nCan I stall Fred?\nOf course I can stall Fred.\nI would do anything. I love Flip and Nancy.\nMe, too! Are we totally crazy?\nMaybe! I don't even care!\nI don't even care, either.\nHm!\nThat's a vodka soda, I think. Uh, it's close enough.\nI hear you! I'm getting to you! Stop yelling at me!\nShut up!\nI don't understand what Cece's doing here.\nShe led the walk-out. If she's gonna be here, can she at least help us?\nI am not gonna scab.\nSorry, bae, I cannot scab, but I'm here for you as your fianc\u00e9.\nYou are my rock right now. Do you need anything?\nNo, I'm good, babe. Okay, just let me know if you do. We are screwed!\nHey! Shut up! I'm trying my hardest!\nI shouldn't have fired Javier.\nI got to apologize. This is all my fault.\nObviously, this is your fault... everybody knows that... but a boss never apologizes; it shows weakness.\nI feel like if Javier came back, the rest of the staff would come back.\nThat's a great idea.\nI just said that.\nSuch a great idea.\nWell, then give me one, because I said it first.\nIf you're giving it for that idea, if it's about that idea, then I deserve one.\nBut I don't want one.\nAnd I felt left out.\n(customers yelling angrily)\nShut up!\nWell, I wonder what's taking them.\nProbably just the traff. You know, the old 'ic.\n(laughing)\n\"The old 'ic.\"\nAnyway, I was thinking, um, is there anything you guys like to do that Fred doesn't like to do?\n'Cause, like, I kind of just want to hang out with you guys and not Fred.\nHm.\nThank you for doing this, by the way. This is great.\nSlow night. Just been... driving around, mouthing along to hip-hop songs.\nMiss Officer, can we go? I'm very hungry, and my possible girlfriend and parents are waiting for us to order, and it feels like you've done over a million tests.\nThat's what I been saying!\nWhere is the justice?\nYou can go when I tell you to go.\nNow, for your next test...\nI want you to pretend you're about to break-dance, but do not actually break-dance.\n(Fred grumbling loudly)\nI didn't mean...\nBuddy, I'm talk...\nWhy would he take that upon him...\nDon't ask.\nOfficer: I mean, whatever.\n \nMan, he's dumb!\nOfficer: Give us more hands.\nDo it more animated.\nBut less alive.\nThat's pretty good.\nAly: Keep all of that but pretend you're underwater.\nDeeper. Deeper.\nOkay, Jess, uh, what's going on here?\nSpill it.\nWell... (groans) it's just you guys are so amazing.\nAnd it's really rough out there, and it's nice to be around something so great.\nAnd I-I'm not really a love match with your son, but I think I might be in love with you guys.\n(chuckles) Jess, we-we are glad that you think that we're amazing. And we think Yes, we are.\nThat you're amazing.\nYes, we do.\nAnd, um... we know that Fred isn't the best.\nWe live with him.\nYou know, he can be so boring.\nI-It's like the apple fell so far from the tree Oh, God... it fell in a truck and then disappeared across state lines.\n(chuckles) You guys are very honest.\nDid Fred ever tell you that he loves model trains?\nOh, those model trains.\nBut he's your son.\nAnd we love him.\nDeeply.\nAnd that's why we want to make a deal with you.\nNancy: You and Fred equals you and us.\nWow. Lo-Lovely home.\nLook, Javier, we've-we've come to give you an incredible opportunity: for you to apologize and get your job back.\nSo, what do you say?\n(chuckles) Okay, uh, well, Javier, let me tell you something. Uh, I've been in the business world for just shy of half of two decades, and I can tell you that an opportunity like this does not come along often. So...\nYour boss is extending his hand.\nSchmidt, stop. Look, Javier, I'm sorry. I messed up.\nNick, don't apologize.\nI've never been a boss before, and it's weird, man.\nYou're my friend, Javier.\nRemember when your cousin was in town and-and my cousin was in town and we kissed each other's cousins and... then we peed on the ice maker?\nYes. I remember that fondly.\nSo rough.\nLook, we both chose the bar over other stuff.\nI-I could've been a lawyer, and-and you were a dentist.\nWere you, really? You were gonna be a dentist?\nEndodontist.\nLook, it's my job to keep the bar open, but I still want it to be a great place to work.\nIf you come back, that'll be my top priority.\nThat and getting your old skanky cousin back in town, so I could make out with her.\nAnd my skanky cousin back in town so you could make out with her.\nSo what do you say?\nI say... your mother. (chuckles)\nYour mother.\nYour mother.\nYour mother!\nYour mother!\nNo, your mother!\n(laughing)\nAh, you son of a bitch.\nI love you, man. Oh.\nYou're the best. Yeah, you guys! Let's do it! My h...\nNext hand in, right? N...\nOkay, so you're saying that if I date Fred that we can all keep hanging out together.\nYes. We don't want you to lose us or for us to lose you.\nYou're the child that we always wanted to have.\nImagine us as grandparents.\nYou think I haven't already?\nYou'll learn to love Fred.\nAnd even better, you'll never have to go on a first date again.\nYeah. That sounds really good.\nThere's no rush. I mean, why don't we go up to the Vermont house in the next few weeks and all be together?\nVermont house?\nOh, yeah.\nIt's an 18th century farmhouse that we kind of refurbished.\nGah. Oh.\nWe send romantic notes on the clothesline.\nOh, my geez.\nAnd a loom in the barn.\n(chuckles) Poof.\nHey, there!\nHi!\n(chuckling) Right over here, buddy.\nWinston: I am terribly sorry, you guys.\nWe got held up by an overzealous cop.\nNancy: You know, Fred, uh, Jess was just saying how much she likes model trains, right, Jess?\nFred: I didn't know you were a railie. That's so great.\nWhat's your gauge? Are you a G gauge? Uh, G scale, Gauge one? HO scale? TT scale?\nProbably not a tabletop girl, right?\nDo you do it costumed? Or do you just do it leisurely?\nI deal mostly with the, uh, transitional era, post-Industrial Revolution.\n(groaning) I collect a lot of open-air coal engines. I'm the president of my module group, actually.\nWe use horn hook couplers, so I'm kind of one of the best at scenery building. Uh, just finished this beautiful sanitation depot, made completely out of balsa.\nI also was the first to implement wire-framed humans so that the people are poseable.\nStation agent is now... Now he can bend his arm to say hello as the train passes.\nThere's one little girl I use... I call her Sally.\nI'm also quite good at flocking snow, so I'm very popular around the holidays.\nAah! Stop! Please stop. I just, uh... I ca... I can't do this.\nI can't believe I was even considering doing this.\nI can't just settle down to settle down.\nI really, really want you to consider what you're giving up.\nYeah, Terry Gross owns the house next to us in Vermont.\nOh, my God. Do you run into her at syrup festivals?\nFred: We had a horse.\nUntil it ran away.\nIts name was Daniel.\nDaniel Boulevard.\nI got to pick the last name, and I named him while we were in the car.\nI have to go!\nLet's go.\nHey, listen, Jess and I really aren't that close.\nI'm all about horses.\nJess: We're going!\nSchmidt: You know what, Nick, you were right.\nA bar isn't just a place of business.\nIt's a place for people.\nMm.\nWhich is something I truly hate about it.\nA bunch of bottom-feeders here.\nChum at the bottom of the ocean. Yuck.\nI know. And that's why, as a manager, I'm thinking I have to fire you.\nMaybe you should fire me. What do you think?\nYou save enough money, buy me out one day, you run this place on your own.\nYou really think I could?\nYeah, definitely.\nI mean, your dumb bitch of a mother sure could.\nWhat?\nYour-your mother, who, uh, we're referring to in this circumstance as a dumb bitch.\nI think she could probably...\nWait, what?\nCome on. That's what you and Javier do, right?\nC... Your... Uh, your mother, who, uh, you know, is a dumb... is a dumb...\nIs that not... is that not how the joke goes?\n(chuckling) I know.\nThanks, man.\nThank you.\nUm, can I have another napkin?\nAre you sure?\nUh, yeah, I don't need one.\nYou know what, I know they turned out super weird and kind of like rich pimps, but... I just kind of miss 'em, you know?\nI'm glad they were weird. Kind of snapped me out of it.\nI was about one park day away from a Vermont model train-themed wedding.\nYo, Nick, you like my shirt?\nIt look like I'm naked.\nVery cool, man. (laughs)\nRight.\nCome here, man.\nHey! Get out of here. I'll catch up later. Boss man's got to go over the books.\nOkay.\nGood to have you back, man.\nOh, this is very terrible.\n(dance music playing)\nI don't believe you.\n \nCan you put, like, a jazz spin on that?\n \nLook like an ***.\nStart spinning.\nThat's actually pretty good.\nI just feel really bad for Flip and Nancy.\nShut up about Flip and Nancy.\n"}, {"title": "05x03 - Jury Duty.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nJust make up an excuse and get out of jury duty, Jess.\nPlease, I need you.\nNo, Nick.\nIt's a right and a privilege.\nIn South Africa, they don't even have juries.\nThey have a-a judge and two assessors.\nGod, I would have bullied you as a kid.\nJury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.\nWould I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?\nYeah, I would.\nI've turned in some memorable performances in the past.\nBut it's just one day... you'll be fine without me.\nNow that Cece and Schmidt are engaged, she's here all the time, and her stuff is everywhere.\nOkay, yes, she's a hot slob.\nEver since she got boobs, people stopped making her do stuff.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is not an excuse.\nWhen I first grew boobs, people started handing me stuff, and I got messy, but then you got to grow up.\nNot the same thing.\nThey're just boobs.\nI promise you, tonight when I get back from jury duty, I will explain it to her in a way that she'll listen to, unlike your way, where she'll rip your dingle off and sew it back on your head like a unicorn horn.\nShe doesn't even live here.\nShe never signed our loft agreement.\nShe doesn't even know all the rules.\n(laughing): Hi. Look at you.\nYou look so cute.\n(chuckling): Thank you.\nCece: Love this top.\nJess, Nick needs to stop telling that wet pants story, okay?\nI know.\nI've heard it four times this week.\nSo I take a hot glass out of the dishwasher, I pour cold water into it, then the customer picks up the glass, and the bottom falls off.\nOh, that's crazy.\nFor real?\nNick: He looks down, and he goes, like, (Italian accent): \"Oh, my pants are wet.\"\n(laughing)\nI know, he-he needs to shape that story.\nI don't know how you live with him.\nHe is the most obnoxious...\nWinston: Knock it off. (indistinct arguing)\nHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\nStop. Stop it. Knock it off.\nJess, are you cool with me hanging this groundbreaking poster of dogs playing poker on the wall?\nJess, please tell him that he cannot hang this horrible painting.\nI really have to go.\nI think it's hilarious... they're playing poker.\nRather see a painting of Arnold Schwarzenegger, mid-coitus.\n(grunts)\nJust straight up doing it.\nLet's talk about the painting tonight.\nUh, do nothing till I get home.\nDo nothing till I get home.\nDo nothing till I get home.\nSchmidt: Bye-bye.\nBye.\nOkay. - Yeah.\nNick: That's my guy.\nIs it me, or is Cece really...\nBoth: Messy.\nYes.\n(scoffs) Dude.\nI love it when we say things at...\nSame time. the same time.\nJust... just... we're right there s...\nR-Right there s...\nWait.\nWhen we say things at the... same... time.\nSame... time.\nOkay, now you're getting in your head again.\nJust relax.\nRemember the thing about Cece being really...\nBoth: Messy.\nAnd we say things at the same...\nThe same...\nSee, you're getting in your head because you're going quieter.\nJust go with your gut.\n(groans)\nIsn't Cece really... messy?\nThis is fun. Messy.\n-'Cause we say things at the same... time.\nTime.\nI'm done with you.\nI had it.\n \nTrying to get out of jury duty?\nExcuse me?\nThe way you're dressed, like you're in a school play about old people.\nYou want the judge to think you're crazy.\nThese are my real clothes, and I would never try to get out of jury duty.\nIt's not just a right; it's also a privilege.\nAnd who are you to talk about clothes?\nYou're just wearing a blue suit.\nOh, call Milan.\nNotice I'm not calling Milan.\nWow.\nI'm sorry.\nI actually agree with you.\nCan we start over?\nCan I buy your coffee for you?\nHerbal tea, and make it a big one.\nYou got it.\n(cell phone rings)\nOh, excuse me.\nYeah.\nOh, hey, Nick.\nI just met the other only person in America who cares about jury duty, and he's a gosh-damn dreamboat.\nJess, we have an emergency.\nCece's washing her clothes, and I can't even get down the hall.\nShe's built a laundry dam.\nWell, can't you just step over it?\nNo time.\nYou know I need to go straight from the bathroom to the kitchen. It's a blood sugar thing.\nWinston: Hey, Jess, it's your roommate Winston Bishop.\nIsn't it amazing how a frame can elevate already great art?\nWinston, don't hang that picture till I get home.\nAnd I would talk to Schmidt about it, but it's like he can't even see the mess.\nIt's like he's love-blind or something.\nOh, man, I've never been this happy in my entire life.\nI got to tell you, you guys, Cece and I just had shower sex.\nDon't.\nDid he just kiss you?\nWhy does he act like the Pope when he's happy?\nI guess I'll just talk to Cece myself, and I'll tell her she's a disgusting beast, and she'll have to listen to me 'cause I'm the man of the house.\nWhat?! No, no, no!\nDo not talk to Cece.\nAlso... everything you just said was offensive. Everything.\nDo not talk to Cece.\nIgnore every natural instinct you have.\nWhat's up, dude?\nHey, you mind if I steal Jess for a second?\nBe careful.

Please...\nCece's a hot slob.\nCece, you're a hot slob.\nWhat?\nI'm sorry, what?\nLook around, her stuff is everywhere.\nIt's disgusting.\nHey, Cece, you know what's fly?\nLove that hat.\nCleaning's fly.\nCleaning's cool, dude.\nHey, everybody, I'm Cece Parekh.\nI got a bunch of hats, but I never wear them, 'cause I'm so busy throwing them around, being fly.\nClean up after...!\nLet's get her, Winston.\nAm I right?\nUh, you know...\nI think we should just remember that we all make... mistakes, um...\nDon't get soft on me right now.\nSo keep-keep that in mind as we go forward with our day.\nI'm hard to live with?\nNick: Yeah.\nBecause I got news for you... you are so much harder to live with.\nHey, uh, guys, I-I feel like we're headed down a really unproductive path.\nI made tabbouleh. Who wants some?\nYes. Love some.\nYou tell the same story over and over.\n\"I've got wet pants.\" We get it.\nBottom of the glass fell clean off.\nIt was a science miracle.\nNo, the glass was hot, and the ice made the glass contract, and that is why it broke; not funny the first six times, and not funny now, 'cause, guess what, Nick Miller... not always funny.\nNo...\nWhoa.\nHe's... so funny. You're so funny.\nI'm... You don't have to hold me back. There's not a problem.\n(chuckles) Say what you got to say.\nYou want to say anything else, say it.\nNot always funny.\nSay it to my face.\nNot always funny.\nSay it again.\nNot always funny.\n(whispering): Say it again.\nNot always funny.\nSay it again.\nNot always funny.\nSay it again.\nNot always funny.\nSay it again.\nSchmidt: So why don't we just sit down and... and talk this out like adults?\nI would love to, Schmidty, but where will we sit?\nOkay.\nOh, perhaps we'll sit on this pile of uneaten carrots.\nIt's like I'm living with Secretariat, the horse!\n(laughs) He's hilarious.\nOn the plus side, I'm being very witty during this fight!\nYou know what, Nick?\nWoman: Number 24.\nNumber 16.\nYes! Sorry.\nI never win anything.\n(phone ringing)\nSorry. Uh, uh... oh.\nDr. Foster, is everything okay?\nFoster: J.D.?\nIt ain't.\nI decided I was gonna be Marcus the Meerkat, because, you know, you and I have remarkably similar body shapes.\nOkay.\nUm, what's the problem?\nI fell and shattered my hip.\nOh, God! I'm so sorry.\nHow bad is it?\nThe, uh, paramedic described my left leg as a skin bag full of hip shards?\nA skin... a skin bag full of hip shards.\nYou're gonna have to take over my duties.\nWe are talking about the big job: acting principal.\nYes!\nI'd love to!\nOh... but my number just got called.\nWell, that means the district's gonna be bringing in Becky Cavatappi.\nUgh!\nThey've been pushing her for my job.\nShe has fake zoomers.\nWhat kind of message does that send to girls with growing zoomers?\nI think she had her butt done, too.\nEvery time she runs, that thing sounds like an Indian rain stick.\nI really want to be principal, so, um...\nI'll be there.\nUh, I'll just have to, uh... get out of jury duty.\nI'll talk to you soon!\n(shrieks in pain)\nSorry. It's a tense situation.\nSo who should I call next to tell my story?\nI'm not cleaning till you get off the phone, Nicole.\nHow about Patty's Pizza?\nSmooth it out, smooth it out.\n(cracking sounds)\nOh, boy.\nYou are angry.\n(phone ringing)\nWinston, I need your help...\n(whispering): getting out of jury duty Jessica damn Day!\nI know, I'm a terrible person.\nPut Nick on the phone.\nNo can do, J.\nHe and Cece are in it.\n(indistinct shouting)\nWhat? I told him not to talk to her.\nHow bad is it? Is Nick standing really wide-legged?\nIs Cece calling him mean girl names?\nDon't call me Nicole!\nOkay, Nick-hole!\nYeah. That's happening.\nKids, huh?\nYeah.\nIs that Jess? Jess.\nIt's awful.\nI don't know what to do. I'm sure Cece has her flaws, but I just can't see them.\nAnd even if I could, what would I do?\nHow does a man stand up to the sunset?\nCece and Nick are basically the same person.\nBoth stubborn, hotheaded and brutally honest.\nOh, dear Lord.\nI'm marrying Nick.\nDuh.\nAw. I kind of love that.\nAll right, what should we do?\nCan't go to Cece's apartment.\nNadia's baby is teething.\nHave you ever heard a Russian child scream?\nAll the time, in my Putin nightmare.\nLook, get Cece to sign the loftgreement.\nNick wrote it, so he'll like that.\nThey'll both play hardball till they get bored, which will be immediately.\nThat's good.\n\n\n\nYou've impressed me today.\nOh, wait, wait. Is that Jess?\nHey, hey. Give me the phone.\nAll right.\nHey, Jess, Nick-hole here...\nWhat?\nStop calling me Nicole! I'm a boy!\nCece: Nick is calling everyone he knows to tell them this dumb story.\nHello, your friend is a pig person.\nGuys, stop.\nHey, Chaz, I'm on the other line.\nYou're not gonna believe what happens to this glass.\nIt's an incredible story; you're gonna freak out.\nPlease stop.\nI'll talk to you soon.\nJess: Put me on speaker.\nHold on.\nButton's right there.\nI know which button it is.\nNow, what I'm about to say might shock you, but I need help getting out of jury duty.\nOh-ho-ho!\nWell, well, well...\nLook, I have the chance to be acting principal.\nYou don't know Becky Cavatappi, but she's a murderer.\nWhat?\nShe-she's not a murderer, but I... I really don't like her.\nYou can't just be going around throwing \"murderer\" on people.\nGuys, I need to go in right now. What do I do?\nWhatever the trial's about, I say I don't believe in it.\nJust tell them that your parents are Pakistani militants.\nThat's what I do; works every time.\nYeah.\nWhy'd you have an accent when you said \"Pakistani\"?\nBecause that's actually how you pronounce it. \"Pakazani\"?\nIt's great seeing you guys work together.\nYou said it stupid.\nI don't really want to lie.\nIt's kind of not really my brand.\nYou'll never see any of these people again.\nThere are no consequences. Okay. Uh, I gotta go.\nJust remember you're a garbage person and you hate America.\nI'm a garbage person who hates America.\nWoman: Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God?\nThe whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me Gob.\nDid... did you just say \"Gob\"?\nDid you say \"Gob\"?\nWhat?\nYeah, she said \"Gob.\"\nWhose side are you on?\nJustice.\n \nDaniel: This question is for potential juror number 16.\nThis case involves marriage.\nI don't believe in marriage.\nExcuse me, you don't believe in marriage?\nAs a concept?\nWell, you know, you gotta keep the freeway open.\nUh, 'cause... sooner or later, you're gonna get tired of the same cars driving down it.\nCapiche?\nYes, capiche.\nThe two things that are ruining this country are marriage and democracy.\nHow refreshing.\nAnother person who wants to get out of jury duty.\nI thought some people took this seriously, but apparently not.\nTrial by jury is a pillar of our democracy, and yes, it is inconvenient.\nBut sometimes, sacrifice and civic duty are.\nYou don't deserve the honor of serving your country.\nMaybe you should live in South Africa, where they don't have juries.\nI know, I know!\nThey have a judge and two assessors.\nLook, I'm-I'm so sorry.\nI didn't mean all that other stuff.\nI'd be a great juror.\nIf you put me on this jury, you will not regret it.\nThat was an emotional moment, and I feel it would be best punctuated with a... crash of that thing.\nNah.\n \nThe roommate loft agreement was formed in the year of our Lord 2005.\nHurricane Katrina had just decimated the American South, but we here, in Loft 4D, had gone through, well, perhaps in many ways a more horrifying Katrina.\nYou can't say that.\nCan't say that.\nA kitchen condom disposal clause?\nThat is not a relevant clause.\nNot relevant? I almost died.\nUgh.\nWinston!\nYeah?\nStop having sex in the sink!\nOkay.\nFirst clause: \"If a roommate has five or more grooming products in the bathroom, they must use a shower caddy or pay an additional ten dollars in rent, adjusted every two years for inflation.\"\nI currently pay an additional $11.97 in rent.\nOkay, yeah, well, I'm not using a shower caddy, because I'm an adult woman and I don't live in a dorm.\nHave you been to a dorm recently?\nIt's like a spa.\nThose horny texters live like kings.\nNick is really damaging this negotiation.\nHey, speaking of damages, you know, what if we all pitched in to fix loft damages?\nI don't know, let's say...\nNick broke something, like a wall.\nI'll fix it. I can fix anything.\nYeah, not according to the \"Nick can't do electrical work\" clause.\nNo, no, don't touch him! He's electric, he's electric!\nHot!\nCece, you're the love of my life, but I-I kindly ask that you don't read ahead.\nCece: Okay, fine.\nI'll use a shower caddy, okay?\nAnd now that I've agreed to my thing, can we just agree that Nick can limit his stories?\nYou trying to take away my constitutional right to be hilarious?\nFine. I won't use a shower caddy.\nUse the caddy, I'll be less chatty.\nIt's hilarious.\nIt's undeniably hilarious that I just said that.\nDo you hear yourself?\nGreat, we're in agreement.\nNow just sign here, and we'll give you a key.\nGive her a key? (scoffs)\nI'm a little confused.\nIs that really necessary?\nIt's like giving a squirrel a key to the park.\nThe park is always open, and the squirrel is there with rabbit, and squirrel and rabbit are there all the time.\nSo does squirrel need key?\nWhat is happening?

It's not...\n\"Nick's Life Plan\"?\nWhat is that?!\nI'm just trying to keep you on track, Nick.\nLook, we've always done everything together, and I'm just worried that we're gonna drift apart.\nYou know, I'm gonna get married and have kids, and you're gonna be wandering around the grocery store, holding a bottle of Scotch and an ear of corn.\nOkay, you know what?\nYou know what I have to say to you, Schmidt? Boundaries.\nYou know, you and me.\nBoundaries.\nAll right, let's do this.\nWe're having a baby!\nYes. - Yeah.\nCarol: Oh, my God, my boobs are gonna get huge!

Yankees suck!\nThis really means a lot to me, man.\nI'm sorry I couldn't do it myself.\nYeah, you know what I think it was?\nOne time, I got stung in the penis five different times by five different bees five days in a row.\nWhat were you doing that your naked penis was exposed to bumblebees?\nWhy is he here?\nYou know, even though I don't approve of this, I would never, ever leave you in your time of need.\nSchmidt, I don't want you here.\nI told him I didn't want him here.\nI can't be any more clear on that.\nI botched it!\nBotched it good!

Just please come back in here with me.\nThank you.\nNever seen two guys so close like that, you know.\nMy dad and his... and his friend Joe were close like that.\nOh, yeah?\nMm-hmm.\nWell, you got in my head.\nYou got in my head.\nWhy'd you have to tell me about the plan, Schmidt?\nNow I need to know what happens.\nWhy am I not supposed to have a baby this way?\nAs I saw it, your first child was to be born between you and a small Italian woman.\nLike a Maria?\nYes, like a Maria.\nOkay.\nShe makes meatballs and soup, and does laundry in a wooden bucket.\nYeah, she does.\nYou guys have a child.\nIt's a boy. I'm incredibly involved.\nI give him the other half of a walkie-talkie just in case he ever has a question in the middle of the night.\n(imitates static) Yes, I'm here.\nHe hides his broccoli in a planter during dinner.\nI wink. I look the other way.\nYou mean e-broccoli.\nWhat?\n'Cause it's the future.\nHow far in the future are you planning on having a child?\nWell, if we're talking about me meeting a woman, falling in love and having a kid?\nA very, very, very, very long time.\nSo many \"verys.\"\nAnd let's face the facts.\nMy love life is a disaster.\nSchmidt, this might be my only chance of having a kid.\nDon't say that.\nI'm saying it.\nAnd if I can't have a kid with a woman, then maybe I'll have one with my cousin.\nHorrifying wording for what actually is, well, a beautiful sentiment.\nI-I want to do this.\nI want to experience this.\nYou know, and I know I won't be able to raise him, and... and that's disappointing, but...\nI'll still see the little guy at parties and such.\nSay hi. He'll say hi.\nGive him some fireworks to pop off, or... or e-fireworks.\nMan, I'm just...\nI'm getting excited just thinking about this.\nLook, it's not how I originally planned it, but it's still another Nick Miller in the world, and I'll take that any way I can get it.\nYou have my blessing.\nWell, it's embarrassing to admit, but... thanks, man, I kind of needed it.\nYeah, absolutely.\n(laughs)\nYou should get out of here, man. I'm gonna go masturbate.\nOkay.\n(groaning)\nWe... really got after it there.\nI am so happy I could help.\nLike, I don't want to be... greedy about it, 'cause I know I've already put on the most perfect dress once today, and I should wait...\nYou thinking what I'm thinking?\nI really want to put it on again.\nYou should put it on again.\nI know!\nOkay, I'm going to go try it on.\nOkay, try it on again.\nOkay.\nCece: Oh, no!\nOh, no.\nWhat did we do?\nWhat is this?\nOh, my God!\nHow drunk were we?\nNo.\nNo. Okay.\nYou know what, no, no, no, no.\nThis is, you know what, this is, this is good.\nEverything's all right.\nI mean, look, you got mirrors.\nYou know, no one's ever done that before.\nI like it, you know. I like the...\nAgain, I can't talk enough about the mirrors.\nWhy is there a spot for batteries?\nSo the glass can light up.\nWe were really excited about that feature.\nYeah. You look like a prostitute for wizards.\nI look like a bullfighter in space.\nI cannot get married in this dress.\nOkay, so what do you need me to do?\nNothing. I don't need your help.\nOkay. 'Cause I'm just...\nI'm gonna do it by myself.\nWell...\nYeah, well, no, I...\n\n\n\nYou washed?\nYeah, of course I washed.\nHey, why the... why the long faces?\nShouldn't we be celebrating here, guys?\nListen, we, uh, we talked to the doctor and, uh, turns out we can't afford the procedure.\nAre you kidding me?\nSo I just masturbated for nothing?\nSchmidt: You-you guys flew across the country.\nYou didn't think about any of this beforehand?\nWe did little to no research.\nBut we still want to have a family, you know.\nYeah.\nWe already fell in love with the little bastard.\nAnyway, there is one other option we could explore.\nWhat is it? Anything.\nNick...\nI want you to have sex with my wife.\nWhat?\nCarol: Yeah, we don't just need your reindeer, we need Santa.\nSchmidt: What? What?\nYeah, come down the chimney.\nFeet first.\nWhite Christmas.\nBring a sackful of gifts.\nThis is nuts. I can't do this.\nThis might be your only chance to have a kid.\nYeah, but then I have to have sex with my cousin.\nI don't want to have... I don't want to have sex with my cousin.\nIt's not your cousin. It's your cousin's wife.\nThat's like letting a dog drink water out of your mouth.\nYou know, it's not great, but it's legal.\nThe point I'm trying to make is, is I think I'd like another Nick Miller in the world.\nAll right.\nCan you imagine?\n(chuckles)\nCome on, man, what do you say?\n(sighs)\nSchmidt: I think the best thing to do here is to just look at this like a medical procedure.\nWhy is this guy in this conversation here?\nBobby, it's a losing battle. Just move past it.\nAnd, Carol, look, I don't want this to feel, I-I don't know, romantic.\nI don't want you getting confused.\nThere's a zero percent chance of that happening.\nYeah.\nIf you're suggesting that I can't be romantic, then you're out of your mind.\nSchmidt: Yeah, excuse me, Nick is very romantic, okay?\nHe does romantic things for me all the time.\nSchmidt, what are you talking about?\nJust the other week, you were very romantic to me.\nWhen I fell down in the parking lot and you picked me up?\n(talking indistinctly)\n(grunts)\nGet up, dude!\nHow was that romantic?!\nIt was beautiful and it was kind.\nYou know, romance doesn't always have to be sexual, you idiot.\nYou're the idiot!\nDon't. Don't.\nHonestly, you want to do this right now?\nGive me one shot at that big head, I'm gonna knock you out. (chuckles)\nDominated you physically. Admit it.\nYeah, defense.\nCan we put something over the windows?\nI want it to be pitch black in here, so I can't see...\nI don't like the way you look at my body when you say that, Carol.\nWell...\nSchmidt: Okay, we got to keep it positive.\nI agree.\nI think what Nick is trying to say Uh-huh.\nIs that he'd like to be completely naked.\nWhere are you getting this from?!\nObjection, Your Honor! Strongly!\n'Cause I will be wearing clothes!\nOverruled. Yeah.\nOverruled.\nYeah, stand down.\nBut I'll-I'll tell ya, I'm not wearing a condom! End of discussion.\n(laughs)\nGuys... such a clearly great joke.\nBecause obviously I can't wear, you know...\nOh.\nWe got to loosen the vibe a little.\nCan we do something about this smell?\nOh, yeah.\n(sniffs) It is a little rank, yeah.\nThere is an odor.\nYeah.\nWell, I lost a glass of milk.\nYou lost a glass of milk? Was it full?\nYeah, it was to the top.\nI could barely carry it.\nOh, that's outrageous!\nOh, God.\nNow, if you don't mind, I'd just like to bring things down for a second here.\nBob, Carol, um, I originally bought this for Nick, but since he may never have someone to give it to, I'd like for you guys to have it.\nMm-mm.\nNo, dude, no.\nWe're Pats fan. We hate the Bears.\nYou don't like the onesie?\nPats are number onesie.\nWhere did we land on me being in the room?\nGet out, Schmidt!\nGet the hell out of here!\nLook, I-I know that you have a \"no return\" policy, but you have to take this dress back, okay?\nI look like a rich person in The Hunger Games.\nYeah, I know. (chuckles)\nI was gonna stop you from buying it, but I didn't, so we're done here.\nWrong!\nSee, you may be done with her, but you're not done with the law.\nWinston Bishop, LAPD.\nYou're a cop? The guy who was spinning around singing Patti LaBelle songs yesterday?\n(high-pitched):  I tidied up my point of view \n I got a new attitude.\nAnd you must be the one who was serving champagne without a liquor license.\nWe don't charge for it.\nIt's legal.\nUh, not if it's being served to a-a minor.\nOh.\nYeah. Oh, that's right.\nI'm 17 years old. I'm a kid.\nYou're a 17-year-old police officer?\nI'm a cop prodigy.\nYou see, my school is the streets.\nBut my other school is school.\n'Cause-'cause I go to school.\nLike a school-school, for learning.\nYou are so stupid.\nNo return policy is more important than the love that brings us here today, so...\nThis means a lot to her, so please help her out.\nWell, that didn't work.\nLook, Cece, I'm-I'm no good at this.\nI'm no help. I'm just gonna...\nI'm just gonna take a backseat to the wedding.\nNo. Look... what you did in there made me realize how much you... really care about me.\nI know that you're already one of Schmidt's groomsmen, um, but I was hoping you would maybe also consider being one of my bridesmaids.\nYou want me to be a bridesmaid?\nIf you don't want to, I...\nDo you know who you're talking to?\nYes?\nYou're talking to Winnie the Bish!\nYeah.\nI would love to be your bridesmaid!\nYes?\nYes!\nYes?\nYes!\nOh...\nGirl, you are under arrest for taking my breath away!\n(laughs)\nWhat's with this parachute top?\nIt's good for movement, hard to stain.\nI thought it was appropriate.\nOkay. I don't know what you think we're about to do, but I'm keeping this very simple.\nI want to keep it simple.\nUh-huh. Great.\nShould we... should we just make love now, then?\n\"Make love\"?\nWhat, are we riding horses around on a beach topless?\nNo, thank you.\nJust tip me over and pour me out!\nTip you over and pour you out?\nYeah. It's that children's rhyme that's also very sexual.\nIt is not sexual at all.\nIt is in this case.\nCarol, I'm g... I'm gonna need you to be a little bit nicer to me, please.\nOh, my God, are you serious?\nI can't p...\nListen, I can't perform sexually if I don't feel a-at least a little desired.\nOkay.\nCould you give me any sort of a compliment? Anything.\nWe'll go and then we'll just... That will get me started.\nI'll say something nice about you then and we can get into it.\n(groans)\nJust one compliment.\nNothing on the front. Can you turn around?\nNo. Keep turning.\nNo.\nStop. Ah!\nOkay, I won't... Okay.\nPlease.\nUm...\nFirst thing that pops in your head.\n(sighs)\nOh, Nicky, you're such a sexy boy.\n(groans)\nIt felt crazy coming out of my mouth. Right?\nJust some... just something simple.\nOh, my God.\nJust take your pants off and get in bed.\nOkay, yeah. All right!\nOkay?\n(breathing deeply)\nCome on!\n(sportscast playing over TV)\nAny plans to go to the beach while you're in Los Angeles?\nCarol: Bob! He's freaking out!\nOh.\nNick?\nI'm not freaking out. I'm fine. Just my heart's beating really fast.\nI feel a bit dizzy.\nCarol: Are you freaking kidding me?\nJust need one sec.\nThis is ridiculous!\nAll I did was take my shoes off.\nStand up and deliver!\nWhat happened? What happened?\nIs it over? Did you like it?\nNo! Look at him.\nI just need one minute. I just need one minute.\nEverything's cool! Deal's on. I just need one minute.\nGet ahold of yourself, man!\nHey, I'm ovulating for two more hours. I need to get plowed!\nYou're dressed like you're gonna run a marathon!\nTake off your windbreaker!\nSchmidt, tell them to stop yelling at me!\nNo! You compose yourself and you make a miracle, or I will squeeze one out of you like a bottle of mustard!\nWhat?!\nTake your pants off!\nThere's not even a belt or a button!\nJust pull 'em down!\nYeah, let's go with the miracle already!\nCome on, man!\n(all shouting)\nNo! Stop! Stop!\nJust take your pants off!\nFive minutes, and it's done.\nI don't like this! I don't like this!\nTake your pants off!\nDo it! Do it, Nick!\nCome on, man! Do it!\nTake it out and do it!\nBoundaries! I said I need boundaries!\nGet out of my way!\nI need boundaries!\nUnbelievable.\nWow. So typical.\n(sighs)\nOh, look at that.\nThere's the glass of milk.\nReally is filled to the brim. It's like an infinity pool.\nWow, how the hell did he carry that thing?\nBobby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible.\nNo, no, no, no. It was a bad call.\nYeah, I guess it's weird to have sex with your cousin's wife.\nNo. I...\nI just can't stomach my kid coming from a Bears fan, that's all.\nThere's nothing wrong with being a Bears fan.\nThat's all I'm gonna say to that.\nThere kind of is.\nNo, it's weird to have sex with your cousin's wife.\nThat's what's weird.\nWe're gonna ask Cousin Terry.\nHe's got no arm past his elbow, but it was an accident; it's not genetic.\nIt's a good call. He's very good-looking.\nUh, excuse me. So we're not having a baby?\nWell, this is... this is just great.\nIf you can't tell, I am being sarcastic.\nWhat's with that guy?\n(sighs) He was really fat as a kid.\nNow I get it.\nAh, that makes sense.\nYeah.\nWe need to have a talk about today.\nI know. Boundaries.\nNo.\nIt's...\nI want you to have something.\nWhat's this for?\nI want you to save that and give it back to me when I have my own kid.\nWhat do you mean, you're gonna have your own kid?\nWhen I have my own kid. Don't make a big deal of it.\nI just... I don't... I don't hate your plan.\nI kind of like it.\nThings have been going pretty good for me lately, and I-I would like to meet my own Maria.\nWith-a the meatballs.\nWith-a the red sauce.\n(laughs): With-a the red sauce.\nI want to see that plan you got for me.\nWell, come on, man.\nIt's a rough draft, but you should check it out.\nWhat do we got here, chief?\n\"Nick has a boy. He calls him Gio.\"\nWe die on the same day in 2098?\nYou murder me and then kill yourself.\nThere's not a chance I make it to 2098.\nNot a chance.\nI don't want to see the 2050s.\nOddly enough, you won't.\nSee? I freeze you from 2050 to 2064.\nThat's why you're the genius. That's why you're the genius.\nThank you.\n(chuckles)\nCan you see her?\nJess?\nHey. Hey, guys.

I want magic.\nIs that so bad?\nI want the music to swell.\nI want the wind to blow.\nI-I want the clouds to part.\nYeah.\nLove! Magic!\nSomething exciting!\nWhy are you yelling?\nBecause I am embarrassed!\nDon't be embarrassed, man, I want magic, too.\nI want her to have a metal bra, and then I got a sword in my hand, and guess what, we both wearing skirts.\nAnd we're riding on flying horses.\nThat's more like dork magic.\nOkay, I don't want to upset you guys, but if you keep looking for magic, you're gonna be alone forever.\nDid you just say you don't mean to upset us and then tell us we're gonna end up alone?\nI actually don't care if I upset you.\nYeah, 'cause that's really upsetting.\nYou know, I got to... I got to say, I'm with Aly on this one, she's making sense, which is why she always plays \"smart cop\" when we play \"Smart Cop/Dumb Cop.\"\nNot a game we play.\nI'm super worried you think we do, terrified.\nI feel like we're playing it right now.\nGreat \"dumb cop,\" great \"smart cop.\"\nYou two need to get realistic.\nYou're not getting any younger, Nick.\nWrong.\nI'm in the prime of my life.\nWatch me do my thing.\nShow her, dude. Get it!\nShow her what you got, Nick.\n(chuckles with exertion)\nSee it?

I feel like one of those characters in the show Sax and the City talking about this.\nOh, no, you mean, um, uh, sex and the City.\nI'm talking about the one with the four ladies in a jazz band.\nThat's not a show.\nCarrie, Miranda, No. the other one and the older one.\nYou're thinking of sex and the City.\nThey would never allow that 'cause of the title.\n(chuckles) Anyway, man, I'm with you, you know?\nI think we should be more realistic about who we're dating.\nWe got to keep each other from dreaming.\n(both chuckle)\nSo if you see me dreaming...\nPinch you.\nWell, don't pinch me, but just let me know.\nOkay.\nLet's make a deal.\nLet's make a deal.\nI got your back, you got my back.\nYeah.\nIt's time.\nIt's time.\n \nWhy did y...?\nReagan Lucas to see Dr. Richards.\nI'm so sorry, Dr. Richards is...\nHe's right behind that water cooler.\nWhy don't I see any orders for Recombinex from you this month, Don?\nWell, um... What is this?\nSpectavir, Donny?\nAre you kidding me?\nMaybe we can talk when you've...\nWhen I've had a chance to consult my physician about the possible side effects of Spectavir?\nSide effects which include dry mouth and diarrhea, wet mouth and constipation, butt sneezing, hysterical deafness, unwelcomed night-running, dusty semen...\nYou know what, why don't I put in an order for Recombinex.\nOoh, great, but only if you want to.\nAnything else I can do for you?\nNot unless you can get me a hotel room downtown for the next month.\nMy company is putting me at the Redbrick Lodge and Seafood Hut.\nUgh. My key is a fish.\nWe have a room... we have a room available.\nI overheard you, sorry... we have a room.\nUh, my name is Nick, uh, Nicholas for long.\nUh, my friend and I have a lovely room for rent in our loft downtown.\nYou see, our old roommate is on jury duty.\nHer name is Jess, Jessica.\nWe had a little \"will they/won't they.\"\nThen we did, and then we fought a little bit too much.\nWe still have a really nice thing.\nWinston: Excuse me, ma'am.\nI am truly sorry for my friend here, but I am sure it is not realistic that you would want to rent a place from total strangers.\nNormally, no, but I have a lobster tank in my bedroom.\nWe have no lobsters.\nWhat is the rent like?\nWhat do you want it to be? I don't care.\nWhat?\nCheap.\nAmenities?\nYeah, we got those.\nYou got a rain shower? I love a rain shower.\nRain shower? Crazy enough, we were installing one today.\nWell, you are weirdly checking all of my boxes, so... I'll come take a look.\nGreat, good, the, uh, the address is... right here on the form under my name.\nGreat, I'll see you tonight.\nGood luck with your...\n\"smush pain that feels like everything came out of the sandwich.\"\nDoesn't even hurt that much, actually.\n \nNick, this is crazy.\nCome on, man.\nWe agreed to not let each other do exactly this anymore.\nDo I have to get tough with you?\nJust admit it, you're jealous.\nUh, I'm not, I simply want a demographic breakdown of all the guys who hit on you.\nYou know, jacked dudes, swole dudes, yoked dudes.\nWhat in Megyn Kelly's America are you doing, Nick?\nI'm installing a high-end shower.\nNick's got a crush on a girl who is way out of his league.\nOh...\nOoh...\nDo you want a boom box?\nYou gonna invite her to winter formal?\nWhen you're my age, you don't form crushes anymore.\nI'm past that.\nI don't remember anything about her.\nI mean, what, does she have brown hair, brown eyes, a nose?\nShe had moxie, she ran the room, she commanded it.\n(knocking on door)\nShe's here, she's here.\nAll right, guys, make your hair look good.\nEverybody, make your hair look good, okay?\nDon't embarrass me.\n \nSouth-facing windows, a balcony, stainless steel appliances, and I'm guessing someone with extreme OCD that lives here to keep this place clean.\nHello, I'm Schmidt.\nYou were a large child.\nThat's incredible.\nYes, I-I was obese.\nYou look familiar.\nMTV Beach House, 2003.\nOh, my God, Reagan?!\nReagan: Cece, hi.\nHow are you?\nOh, my God!\nI'm so happy to see you.\nYou, too. You look incredible.\nBarely recognized you.\nWell, you've never seen me dry.\nCece, y-you went to the MTV Beach House?\nDid you get to announce a video and then scream?\nActually, we both did.\nYeah.\nAnd then we hooked up.\nYeah, that's true, too.\n(moans softly)\nIs he okay?\nIt sounds like there's a dishwasher in his face.\nI know, it's just, uh... he's just processing.\n(continues moaning softly)\nWhat a turn of events, the fact that you guys hooked up.\nYou know, that was a big summer for me.\nRemember, I-I pierced my nose.\nI know.\nI forgave my mom.\nI realized that I was bisexual.\nI mean, of course I went for you.\nI go nuts for big boobs.\nI'm a real melon-felon.\nOh, trust me, I remember.\nI think he's having a seizure.\nCece: No, no.\nIt's just that when he has to process a lot of emotions, sometimes he likes to do Nick Cannon's solo from Drumline.\nMaybe it's best if you continue seeing the rest of the apartment and I will, uh, make some snacks with Schmidt here.\nThat's a great idea. Reagan, I'll give you the tour.\nWinston, you don't have to come.\nNo, but I want to.\nOh, don't, you're too sweet.\nAnd I'm walking away.\nYou can stay.\nIt would be my pleasure to come.\nI... literally nobody wants you to come.\nWinston (chuckles): Right this way.\nHey. Can we talk?\nOne second.\nYes, of course.\nWhy, did something of note happen?\nSomeone I hooked up with once is potentially gonna live here.\nTotally fine with it.\nOkay.\nAs long as we both agree that open communication is the key to a healthy relationship.\nOf course.\nJust one second.\nBe right back.\nNick: So that's where you'd put your, uh, body at night.\nAlone or with somebody, up to you.\nOoh.\nWell, I like the room.\nI think I just want to get rid of the pillows, the yarn, the tote bags and anything else that makes me feel racist against white people.\nThat's everything Jess owns, now, isn't it, Nick?\nGone. It's all gone.\nWe'll take care of it.\nWinston is the loft warrior.\nI'm kind of the rock of the group.\nReally?\nHe's the rock of the group, and I'm sure Reagan would love to see how the rock lives.\nOh, my God, it's worse than I thought.\nSo this is my room.\nI love it, it's my safe place.\nThis is where I write my letters to editors.\nI'm a writer.\nIt's where I also write checks to poor people.\nCharity is so important to me.\nOver there, that's, of course, my bed.\nThat's where I dream, that's where I sleep, and, with a lucky lady, I do sex.\nDo with her.\nThis is where I do my exercises.\nI'm fascinated.\nWhat exercises do you do?\nAnything that involves the body, I do.\nI'm good, uh, as my coach says, horizontally and vertically.\nWhat does that even mean?\nYour life coach?\nUh, my trainer, my coach, my leader, my guru...\nIs that a bowl of mashed potatoes under your bed?\nMay God help us if it's not.\nWinston, isn't there anything else you could be doing right now, like, anything?\nReagan, may I show you the bathroom?\nSpecifically, the shower?\nShower's not finished.\nI'd love that.\n(chuckles) To the left.\nWas that installed by a child?\nYes, it was.\nUh, from a Big Brother program I initiated.\nLet's make it rain for the woman.\nShe doesn't need to see it, she doesn't want to see it...\nThat's rude of you. Rude.\nOh, look! Look at the...\nA little boy came in here and did it.\nHe's gonna get better with practice.\nWell, I'm gonna need a working shower, so maybe I should just...\nDon't leave, hold on.\nI... If you leave, the place could be rented.\nIt's a hot property.\nThere's a lot of applications.\nWho am I up against?\nA CEO of a major company with computers.\nHis name is Michael... Silvergold.\nMichael Silvergold.\nWhat is his credit score?\nMichael Silvergold?\nMm-hmm.\nT... twenty.\nTwenty?\nFive.\nTwenty-five.\nThousand.\n\n\n\nOkay. Just fix the shower.\nIt needs to be in the center of the ceiling and water needs to come out of it.\nYou have a cat, don't you?\nHow'd you know?\nIt's very obvious.\nUh...\nOuch... shoot.\n(sucks in breath) Hold on, let me see.\nOkay. You know what? Hold on a second.\nWe have this new heat-activated antiseptic gel.\nYou're gonna love it.\nAstronauts use it to masturbate.\nYou are kind. You are brave.\nYou are a Maccabee.\nYou are Daddy's favorite boy.\nYou are loved by a wonderful woman.\nDeep breath in...\n(inhales)\nAll heart, all action.\nMovement, direction, directive.\nReagan: Is it working?\nYeah, I feel it getting hot.\nOh, that's because it has whale in it.\nCece: So weird.\nYeah.\nYou're really good at this.\nThanks. Well, you have good hands.\nNo!\nBack off, Beach House!\nSo you're totally fine, huh?\nAre you freaking out because she hooked up with a woman?\nThat's so boring.\nNot at all.\nI completely appreciate the fluidity of sexuality.\nI'm basically a woman myself.\nYou're losing the thread.\nI am freaking out, Reagan, because you're trying to steal my fianc\u00e9e.\nNo, I'm not.\nWhat are you talking about now?\nEverybody knows that there is a window of time before any wedding where some amazing person comes out of the woodwork and tries to steal a bride.\nIt's the plot of every romantic comedy.\nI'm the Bridgette Wilson-Sampras here!\nWho?\nI don't know.\nOh, I suppose you're both too \"cool\" to have seen The Wedding Planner!\nWell, I've seen it.\nYou know what? I didn't even know that you were engaged.\nI didn't see a ring.\nI am working on it!\nNow get out, and you-you've crossed the line!\nHere's the line and you've crossed over it. Out!\nNo. Schmidt, enough.\nShe's staying, I'm leaving.\nYou really don't trust me, do you?\nJust... Cece, pl-please...\nDarling, sit...\n(door shuts) That went well for you.\nI feel like I didn't handle that situation correctly.\n(door opens, shuts)\nUtilities are not included.\nJust wanted to make sure that didn't get lost in all of this.\nDamn it.\nAre you sucking on a block of cheese?\nNo.\nOh, my God.\nHere.\nTake this free sample of antacids.\nConsider it a parting gift.\nI don't want this anyway.\nSome weird friend group... shenanigans.\nI can't get involved.\nYou're a real lone wolf, huh?\nNew day, new city?\nA real lady Costner.\nI'm gonna take off. So, what?\nYou just light fires and then walk away?\nI'm sorry, are you blaming me for what happened with you and Cece?\nOh, no, no, no. I'm just saying that it's all your fault, that you caused it.\n-You're pathetic.\nYeah? You're pathetic.\nYou're pathetic.\nYou're pathetic.\nYou're pathetic.\nYou're pathetic, you're pathetic.\nI'm amazing.\nYeah? Well, then, amaze me.\nStay and fix this.\nWhat do you got?\nYou can pick one thing.\nEasy. Uterus-shaped stress toy.\nNot surprised.\n(toy squeaking)\nThis is really helping, thank you.\nCan I also get the double-sided pen?\nNo.\nWinston: Hey, about earlier...\nI'm sorry that I basically let you drown in the shower.\nAnd then called you a soggy little bitch.\nI don't know how to build a rain shower, okay?!\nHelp me!\nI want to help you!\nBut I'm gonna get wet!\nIt's too late for you!\nThere's still time for me!\nI'm sorry I squirted you with all that shampoo.\nIt... it was supposed to be a metaphor, but I-I really just panicked, to be honest with you.\nI was trying to be tough, but it came off as mean.\nNo, I appreciate you looking out for me.\nI-I've got no chance with Reagan.\nShe's hot and she's cool and she's bisexual.\nThat means she likes men and women.\nI know what bisexual means.\nI can't compete with that.\nThat's too many people, Winston, that's all the people!\nIt's time to stop chasing the magic.\nNow I'm gonna ask out a girl who will not stop staring at me.\nBut why do I feel so nervous?\nYou know, I'll tell you why you're nervous, my friend: it's because you're human.\nBecause you're...\nWhere the hell is my cherry?\nIf you are so jealous that you want everyone else to know that Cece is engaged, hey, here's an idea... why don't you get her a ring?\nBecause I'm afraid that whatever ring I get her isn't gonna be good enough.\nAre you worried that the ring won't be good enough or that you won't be good enough?\nAren't you smart?\nYeah, well, of course I am... I'm in sales.\nThat's so funny. I'm in marketing.\nI don't care.\nLook.\nCece is definitely too good for you.\nI know.\nNo, but seriously.\nLike, she's way too good for you.\nNo, I know that.\nLike, you should have never had a shot.\nIt doesn't make any sense.\nNo, trust me.\nI said, like, I-I've known this the whole time.\nI understand quantum physics more than I understand how you ended up with Cece.\nDon't you understand that this is the problem, and I don't understand where I got to where I am right now?\nYou're right, I'm sorry.\nAnd I'm all turned around.\nI'm sorry, let me try and fix it.\nYou have two choices.\nYou can either spend the rest of your life terrified that somebody's gonna swoop in and steal Cece away or you can just love her, and thank the universe that she loves you back for some reason.\nI know what I have to do.\nCome on, we got to go find Cece.\nYou got to go find Cece.\nYou're in this now, too, baby.\nYou're responsible for my marriage.\nDon't you ever call me \"baby\" again.\nYou want to make this about you, Reagan?\nYour car, I'm driving.\nMy car, I'm driving.\nYour car, I'm driving.\nMy car, I'm driving.\nYour car, you're driving.\nExactly.\nI said the wrong thing.\nJen just agreed to go out with me any time, any day, anywhere. How do you feel?\nTotally fine, bordering on no feeling at all.\nAh, yes, the sweet spot.\nShe seems really angry. We... we should probably go.\nGo!\nOkay, I thought you were giving me a hug.\nOh, hey, Schmidt.\nBe careful, okay?\nThere's a guy over there that brought me flowers.\nI might realize that I'm in love with him and run away.\nDoes he come in here often?\nAn unfortunate start.\nLook, I'm sorry for not being open with you.\nThe truth is-is I still can't believe that you're gonna marry me.\nYou spent the summer of 2003 at the MTV Beach House.\nI spent that same summer watching Felicity on VHS and recording a fake radio show where I reviewed snacks.\nI love you.\nAnd I know you love me.\nAnd so... (gasps) I give you my trust.\nYou've always had it.\nAnd I don't feel the need to show the world that I own you by putting some gaudy gem on your hand.\nI love you.\nHa-ha!\nBut you are getting me a real ring.\nYou're gonna have a diamond the size of a raisin.\nWe can go tomorrow.\nWe'll pick it out together. (laughs)\nI did that.\nHey, nice job.\nThank you.\nLet me get you a drink.\n(groans)\nHold on, why don't you take it easy, smush pain, I got it.\n I'd like to rest my heavy head \n Tonight on a bed \n Of California stars \n I'd like to lay my weary bones... \n(music stops)\n I'd love to feel your hand touching mine \n Tell me why \n I must keep working on \n Yes, I'd give my life \n To lay my head tonight on a bed... \nThat is a perfect old-fashioned.\nI know.\n(chuckles)\nMagic.\nMagic! That was magic.\nOkay, you guys saw magic.\nI watched a hot girl pour herself a drink and then leave without paying.\nWait, she left?\nShe's a robber.\nNick has a crush on a robber.\nHow did she leave so fast?\nShe's amazing.\nGuys, we got to go get her now.\nLet's go.\nCece, let's go!\nAh, son of a...\nCece: Schmidt, I'm coming!\nSchmidt: Let's get her! Come on! Let's go!\nUh, you coming?\nOh, I would.\nBut I have to stay here and eat pretzels.\nOkay, I'll call you with an update.\nNo.\nI'll text you with an update.\nDon't.\nUh, ma'am, we're surprising her because we want her to move in with us.\nSee, earlier I said, \"Get out!\"\nAnd she did. (Nick, Cece, Winston clamoring)\nWhich was an embarrassing mistake by me.\nI don't speak English.\nOh, where are you from?\nUm, outside of Connecticut.\nNick: This is a good idea.\nGreat idea.\nThis is a great idea.\nI'm very excited. (shushing)\n(music playing over headphones)\nAll: We want you to move in with us!\n9.9 miles...\nThis just got creepy.\nWhy did we do this?\nI personally did it because I thought the idea was cinematic.\nSchmidt: How loud is her music?\nCece: We just have to get out of here quickly and quietly... we can, we can go out the window.\nNobody's going anywhere.\nWe're not leaving without her. I got this.\nOh, no, no, no. What are you doing?\nNo, Nick.\nI got it.\nNick, don't.\nWhat are you doing?\nI got it. Shh.\nAll: Nick.\n(faint music playing)\nGet off me!\nAw!\nOoh! Nick?\n(Nick groaning)\nWhat are you doing here?!\nThank you for the swift kick to the face.\nPerhaps you want to live in our place.\n(sighs) Genuinely didn't rhyme on purpose.\nI think what he's trying to say is, we want you to come live with us.\nYeah. That's right.\nI'm okay here.\nI actually worked it out so that I get to pick out a lobster to eat at the end of every week.\nIt's a sick deal.\nYou know what's a sick deal?\nFriendship. (all groan)\nThat's an unacceptable segue way.\nI actually like being a loner.\nIt means fewer people break into my hotel room.\nOkay, well, if you're such a loner, then why did you help me with Cece?\nI don't know.\nYou could've left when I kicked you out.\nYou could've left when you caught me beasting that hunk of cheese.\nThat was disgusting.\nBut you stayed.\nNow I'm not leaving.\nAnd Cece's not leaving and Nick...\nWell, Nick physically can't leave.\nWinston's not leaving.\nHey, I'm Winston, by the way.\nNone of us are leaving until you agree to move in with us.\nThis is actually the kindest, creepiest thing that a group of people I've only known for four hours has ever done for me.\nAh, screw it.\nI'm gonna move in!\nHey! Yes!\nOkay, you're gonna hug, we're gonna hug? Okay.\nYeah, yeah.\nIt's happening.\nNick: I can't see what's going on, after being kicked in the head.\nBut I'm picturing a very happy scene.\nHey.\nHi.\nOh, no!\n(both shouting)\nHelp me, Reagan!\nI don't know how to turn it off!\nOh, my... (both screaming)\nThe handle... it's too tight!\nReagan: Let's try it together.\nCece: It's so wet. I can't, I can't get a grip on it!\nNo, is this, is this hot?\nHmm. Yeah, that's hot.\nAah, yeah, that's hot!\nOh, God, it's too wet and slippery!\nNo, Reagan, just if you put your...\nI'm gonna use my teeth!\nCece: Yeah!\nOkay.\n"}, {"title": "05x07 - Wig.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nHey. Uh, where'd you get these burritos?\nFrom the spot on the corner?\nMmm.\nYeah, the spot on the corner.\nYou know I helped a lady give birth in the kitchen?\nUgh.\nNick: That's disgusting.\nA baby in the middle of the place.\nI knew that wasn't going to stop you.\nDisgusting.\nYou didn't tell us you delivered a baby.\nBaby's perfectly fine.\nBut let's just say I did not do a good job.\n(door closes)\nWinston: Oh, Reagan. What's up?\nHey. So, uh, I just jogged past a guy that's offering donkey rides for $50.\nFeel like that's too much for a donkey ride, right?\nNick (mouth full): It's a dog, not a donkey.\nI know that guy. His name is...\nHis name is Stan.\nStan. S-T-A-N.\nHis dog's name's Cheerio.\nHold on.\nIt's not a donkey.\nUm, it's a dog.\nOkay.\n(sighs) That was painful, Nick.\nIt's like watching Cece make a bed.\n(Cece humming a tune)\nJust give me the sheet!\nI can't be normal around Reagan.\nShe's too hot and mysterious.\nI mean, I haven't peed in four days, which is alarming because I have been drinking constantly.\nYep. Nothing.\nThe fact of the matter is, is that she don't want to hang out with us.\nShe's our roommate, but she being straight up discourteous.\nReagan, why don't you join the fiesta, huh?\nI'll make up a pitcher of margaritas.\nThat's tempting, but, uh, if I have one margarita, I'll have eight; and if I have eight, end up riding that donkey all the way to Santa Monica, so...\n(laughing): It'd be great to watch you ride a donkey!\nThanks, but no, thanks.\nNick: There's extra toilet paper in the bathroom! It's...\n(door opens and closes)\nAre you hiding toilet paper again?\nI can't do this.\nDid she hit us with a \"No, thanks\"?\nHow about this? No, thanks, to your \"No, thanks.\"\nHere's what I'm gonna do...\nI'm gonna make her hang out with us whether she wants to or not.\nOh, yeah, this woman just made my nonsexual to-do list.\nYou have a sexual to-do list?\nCece, don't ask.\nNumber one...\nI regret it already.\nJoan Allen.\nOh! Nick!\nShe's back in the kitchen! She's back in the kitchen!\nNick, we're making sex.\nIt hasn't started yet.\nIt's not sex until you put the straw in the coconut.\nIt's called foreplay, you tween.\nYou don't just buy a Porsche off the lot and immediately enter it in the Groser Preis von Deutschland.\nWhat?\nThe Groser Preis von Deutschland.\nJust let me eat in here. I don't want to eat around Reagan.\nWhy not? Oh, I forgot that you're a bear in pants.\nWill you please go eat in your room?\nShe's right across the hall.

We're both running!\nAnd I've been chasing you for miles like a murderer!\nI kind of prefer to run alone.\nYou see?\nThat's your problem right there.\nWe're roommates now, and in our loft, we do things together, like a family.\nOoh, look. A bubbler.\nOh. Oh.\n(slurping loudly)\nOh, that's so good! Mmm.\nThere's a Band-Aid in there.\nWoman: Reagan?\nCamilla. Oh, my God.

What have we here?\nBack on the stick, I see.\nNo, no, no.\nNo. No. I'm just staying with him and his roommates.\nYeah, which is exactly why you got to start hanging out with us more.\nYou know, we only got you for a month.\nI get you for a whole month?\nI'm about to start binge-watching Ken Burns's Jazz.\nOh, Ken Burns's Jazz. (whoops)\nCall you later. I will.\nDo that.\nCall me, yes. Okay, great.\nI'm going to. Okay.\nGreat.\nCan't wait.\nWhat is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?\nI am hooking up with her. I'm dating her a little bit, but I'm over it, and I'm trying to avoid her.\nWhat are you telling people I'm here for a month for?\nOh, you see what we're doing right now?\nWe're vibing, we're talking about stuff!\nOkay, now it's my turn. Let me do you.\nUm... I think I swallowed a Band-Aid earlier.\nNow I have to dump her, and I have never dumped anybody before. I don't know how.\nI travel so much that I usually just disappear.\nWow.\nOkay. I will help you break up with her.\nWhy? 'Cause you've been dumped, like, a million times?\nNo. Because I'm your roommate, and we have each other's backs.\nWait a minute. What makes you think I've been dumped a lot?\nPlease.\nI read you guys the moment I got there.\nNick's deal is, he honest-to-God might be 50.\nSchmidt's deal is he had to Shazam \"Stairway to Heaven.\"\nAnd your deal is you've been dumped a lot.\nYou're pretty good. You're pretty good.\nSchmidt: How did Nick go through so many napkins, yet get salsa everywhere?\nWe've got no privacy, and it has been way, way, way too long since Mama got her biscuits.\nAnd the biscuits... are rising.\nI hope they stick to the pan and get a little brown on the bottom.\nI'm gonna be honest.\nThat went right over my head. I just didn't get it.\nI don't know... I don't know where you're going with it.\nPlus, I can't concentrate. It's filthy in here.\nHow do we keep Nick out of here?! He thinks that Reagan is some sort of superhuman goddess.\nOkay, well, the truth of the matter is, is I kind of get it.\nYou know, when we first met, I had to pretend that all kinds of things were wrong with you just so I wouldn't freak out.\nYou know, like, I gave you a glass eye for a while.\nYou had a wooden foot for a short period of time.\nThere was one week where I pretended that you were a Democrat.\nI am a Democrat.\n(laughing)\nAh, that's so funny. I love you.\nOkay.\nSo we tell Nick she has a glass eye.\nHe'll spin out.\nHe'll think the eye is a government-issued camera taking pictures for Langley.\n(scoffs)\nNick's a conspiracy theorist.\nIt's like an Irish carnival up there... just potato peels, broken rides, fiddle music, dreams left unfulfilled, bloodied soccer jerseys, bunch of women limping around named Moira.\nOkay. So all we have to do is find a detail that won't make him spin out. Easy.\nIt'll be the opposite of easy.\nIt will be difficult.\nOh.\nWe need to come up with something so smart, so nuanced, so... unexpected, so surgical, that only a genius could think of it.\nReagan wears a wig.\nWhat? Get out of here.\nNo, it's true.\nShe-she told me.\nOh, she told you?\nYeah.\nWhen?\nBefore.\n(scoffs)\nWell, the timing definitely checks out.\nThe only question is why.\nPersonal, um, lady reasons.\nI don't want to touch that.\n(blows through lips)\n\"Reagan wears a wig.\"\n\"Told you before.\"\nYep.\n\"Because of lady stuff.\"\nWow.\nI don't buy it.\nDoesn't make sense.\nWe failed.\nPatience. I know my boy.\nBut, Schmidt...\nI know my boy!\nHey, Nick.\nGot to get busy living or get busy dying. Heard.\nWhat are you doing?\nWhat are you doing is the question. What are you doing?\nWere you just smelling my hair?\nNo. I'm just Nicky being Nicky.\nSometimes I feel like you're in one of those weird man-dog body-switch movies.\nYou like those, too? Neither?\n(door opens and closes)\nIt's a wig.\n(yelling): Doesn't make sense!\nWhat?\n(chuckles)\nDing, ding.\nThe biscuits are ready.\nWell, did you make enough for Cousin Andy?\nS...\nI'm-I'm gonna tell you the truth.\nI don't get that one, either. Who the hell is Cousin Andy?\nI just made it up. Mmm.\nReagan, I've been broken up with so many times in so many different places.\nUm, multiple parks, coffee shops, uh, Santa's lap, Kitchen Stadium on Iron Chef, airplanes in economy, economy select, economy comfort, platinum economy, all covered in butterflies...\nI feel like we have established your credentials.\nOkay. So I'm Camilla. Break up with me.\n(clears throat)\n(scoffs) Camilla...\nYes, baby. I love you so much.\nWe have had a lot of really good times together, and I just...\nOh, my God.\nOh, my God, oh, my goodness, oh, my God!\nI knew this was comin'.\nOh, my God, oh, my goodness.\nWhat-what are you doing?\nOh, no. Are you breaking up with me? Why you hate me?\nWhy you hate me so much?\nI don't... I don't hate you. I don't hate you.\nOh, my God, you don't? Oh, my goodness. So you're not breaking up with me.\nWe're gonna have such a happy life together.\nI-I...\nI am. I am breaking up with you.\nOh, my God, you is breakin' up with me.\nWhy you is breakin' up with me and stuff?\nYo, this is mad crazy. I'm pregnant with your child.\nOkay.\nThat isn't possible.\nYeah, his name is D'Lante.\nWe would never name our child that.\nYeah. D-apostrophe-Lante.\nNo, I can't... Look, I can't do this.\nLook, I want you to be happy. Here.\nHere's $80.\nWow. Really?\nYou're just gonna bail?\nYeah.\nI suck at this, obviously.\nI don't want to hurt her.\nHoney, sit down, sit down, sit down.\nHere.\nWhy don't you just be honest about why you're breaking up with her?\nI don't... know.\nI just feel like it's over.\nLet me tell you about some reasons why I've been broken up with.\nUm, \"you're too nasty in bed, Winston.\"\nOr \"you remind me of my brother, Winston.\" Or... or \"Winston, you spend too much time in the butterfly house.\"\nI have an idea.\nOkay.\nWhat if you break up with Camilla for me?\nI'm sorry, what?\nBecause obviously you understand how it feels, and you'll be much more gentle and empathetic.\nWhat? No, that is the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish here.\nThis is a very important moment in your life.\nYou see, you have the ability to change, and that is what I find the most beautiful about human beings.\nIf you do it, I will do a 20-minute roommate dinner.\nOkay, deal.\nI been thinking...\nDamn it, Miller!\nMaybe Winston was right. How well do we know this Reagan character?\nI mean, sure, she wears a wig.\nNot a big deal. Or, let me ask you, is it a big deal?\nAsk yourself, what type of person wears a wig?\nA bald person?\nSure. I'll say so.\nThey're bald. Somebody hiding something?\nDefinitely.\nCece: Okay, look.\nMaybe she's not hiding anything, all right?\nBeyonc\u00e9, Beyonc\u00e9 wears wigs, and you would trust Beyonc\u00e9 with your life.\nYeah, I'd trust Beyonc\u00e9 with my life.\n Ride it with my surfboard \n Surfboard, surfboard \n Bringin' on that wood, oh, baby, bringin' on that wood! \nWe be all night.\nWe be all night.\nNick, is it possible that you are maybe overthinking this just a little bit, okay?\n'Cause, look, Reagan is a really good roommate.\nShe's quiet, she pays, she takes care of her room.\nHer room. That's it.\nGreat thinking.\nThat's why I love you.\nThat's why.\nNot physically.\nUh, but as a person.\nLike, um, it's not sexual. I love you like a mother or a sister or a girlfriend. It's not sexual.\n\n\n\nHer room!\nCome on, come on, come on, come on. Oh!\nJackpot.\nRibbons! Oh, these are probably Jess's.\nNick, stop. You should not be in here.\nI am learning so much about you, Reagan.\nAn Ohio State T-shirt.\nCash from Canada. It's Canadian cash.\nA picture of a little boy.\nThis woman is like an orange. You peel a layer, there's another layer there.\nYou're thinking of an onion. An orange only has one layer.\nOh, you poor thing.\nOkay, someone has to put everything back exactly like they found it.\nWell, it clearly is gonna be me, 'cause I'm the only one who can fold.\nNick, what are you doing?\nI'm making a mess, but I'm finding the truth.\nOkay, I'm gonna end this. Nick, Reagan doesn't wear a wig.\nWe made the whole thing up.\nBut I smelled it and I saw it.\nWe couldn't get you out of our room.\nWhy would you lie to me?\nWell, we wouldn't need to lie to you if you would just talk to Reagan instead of hiding out in my room with your cheap Southwestern food.\nTalk to her? Like a normal human being?\nYes, that's exactly what I want you to do.\nYes. Mm-hmm.\nI have nothing in common with that woman.\nShe is a goddess who's descended from the heavens.\nAnd I'm just a mud man from the bowels of Chicago.\nLet's clean this place up, and let's get out of here.\nShe's gonna be home soon.\nWait.\nWhat are these?\n\"Sarah Nevada\"? \"Suzi Shimizu\"?\nThat's Reagan's face.\nThese are fake I.D.'s.\nFake I.D.'s?\nSchmidt: Okay.\nIt's f... it's fake identification.\nYou're damn right it is, Jack.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nLook, this is a little bit weird, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for this.\nMaybe Nick is onto something here, okay?\nBecause how much do we actually really know about her?\nWho has fake I.D.'s?\nI'll tell you who.\nCon men. Grifters.\nIt's all starting to make sense to me.\nCheck this out. Let me break this down for you.\nOkay? She and her bastard son...\nOr her nephew.\n...who she had with the Ohio State professor, go town to town, selling... let's say fake pills.\nPills. Doctor. Pharmacy. Whatever she does.\nTo a bunch of maple-sucking tree huggers.\nAka those lovely stoners from the north, our Canadian brothers and sisters.\nLet's just clean this place up, and let's get out of here.\n(chuckles)\n(door opens)\nReagan: Guys! Winston made me bring home dinner.\nIt's Reagan.\nOr is it Suzi?\nOh, Jewish God, why do you hate me? Clean up the floor!\nOkay, yeah.\nShe is the one who has to explain herself.\nLet her come in here.\nYou have gone full Nick, Cece.\nWhat does that mean?\nShe's bought into your nonsense!\nEnough. I'm very disappointed with you.\nPut this down. I'll-I'll fold it.\nI just picked it up!\nYou don't know what you're doing.\nHey, Reagan, come in here!\nNo, no, Reagan!\nDon't come in here!\nThere's a possum in here!\nDon't come in here, 'cause there's...\nWhat do you mean Reagan wants to break up with me?\nWho are you?\nI'm her roommate.\nOh, so she sent her roommate to break up with me?\nNow I have no more questions.\nGreat. Then I'm out. Blessings.\nOkay, look, um, I know this is not ideal.\nBut if I'm being honest, she's got a lot of work to do emotionally.\nAre you really gonna let her get away with this?\nYou must know how this makes me feel.\nYou've clearly been dumped many times.\nWhy do people keep saying that?\nYou ordered a Shirley Temple.\nIt's a virgin Denzel.\nIf she wants to dump me, she should man up and look me in the eye.\nYou know what, she should have, and I told her that.\nIt's the least she could have done.\nHey, you're preaching to the choir.\nAsk me how many times I've been dumped.\nI don't have the... 47 times. And once on my birthday.\nAnd out of that 47 times and once on my birthday, do you know what part hurts the most?\nGetting bailed on.\nGetting bailed on.\nWhy do people think they can just disappear on you?\nThey're not thinking at all. Except of themselves.\nLet's go find her.\nHell yeah. Ooh, wait, wait, wait, I just thought about it, and that's not a good idea.\nWhere is she?\nHow you... how you know I know where she at?\nYou said you're roommates.\nDamn.\nBitten by my own snake.\nSo you all went through my room and you each have things that you would like to discuss. Is that correct?\nThat's true.\nYes. - Chicago.\nSo... the money, the fake I.D.'s.\nI have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.\nI carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.\nWho does?\nOkay. All right, fine.\nWhat about this, though... your son?\nHe looks just like you.\nThat is me.\nWait. What?\nOof. Rough haircut. Oh, and if you found something in my room that kind of looks like a hollowed-out hand, that's a glove.\n(clears throat) So I went full Nick, huh?\nYes, you went full Nick.\nRight, yeah, I see that now.\nI'm full Nick every day. Imagine how that feels.\nWe all owe you an apology for... pretty much everything.\nI'm sorry that we went through your room.\nWell, that's not what I'm upset about. I mean, I went through all of your rooms when I first moved in.\nExcuse me?\nWait, you went through our rooms?\nOh, no.\nHow else am I supposed to get to know you?\nBut the point is I didn't jump to conclusions.\nI mean, Nick has a two-by-four in his room with a nail in it.\nI didn't assume he was building a human cage.\nI'm building a tree house.\nYou're doing wha... you're building a tree house?\nWell, why am I not involved? Why is Cece not involved?\nWe want to be involved.\nOh, I'm involved.\nSo's Winston.\nWhat?\nEveryone's involved in the tree house but I?\nForget about it. Reagan, how would you like to build a tree house with me?\nNo.\nReagan, we already got plans, we already got a two-by-four.\nNo. I feel like we are really off-topic here.\nWhat I'm trying to say is: Why did you just assume that I'm a criminal?\nWell, because these two are paranoid maniacs.\nWho apparently are building a tree house together.\nNot apparently. We are.\nMm-hmm.\nOn the other hand, we hardly know anything about you.\nOh, my God. Okay, that's what this is about?\nLook, I'm-I'm only gonna be here for a few weeks.\nThere is no reason to get all emotionally involved.\nLet's just keep it clean, and that way nobody gets upset.\nI am so upset right now.\nWinston: Uh, let me get ahead of this, roomie.\nI did not help out today.\nCamilla.\nHi, baby, hi.\nWhat are you doing here?\nCut the crap.\nWhy?\nYou sent him to dump me?\nNo. (scoffs) To dump you?\nNo. Why would I do that... Why would you do that?\nNick: What the hell, man?\nCece: That is crazy.\nWhy would anyone do that?\nWhat's wrong with you?\n(quietly): Tell the truth, you sneaky woman.\nReagan, are you dumping me or not?\nNo.\nKind of.\nLook, Camilla, I, uh...\nI don't want to... I don't want to hurt you.\nJust say it.\nOkay. (clears throat)\nThe truth is...\n...that I'm a criminal.\nWhat?\nI'm a criminal.\nYou shouldn't be with me. I'm disgusting.\nThings I've done.\nThings I'm capable of.\nHard life, short life... I probably won't live that long.\nI can't believe this.\nShe's a criminal.\nFilthy.\nDisgusting crimes.\nOne of the worst human beings I've ever met in my life.\nAnd who are you?\nI'm her, uh, co-criminal.\nCo-gangster. We run the streets together.\nFrom Bangkok to Chicago to here.\nJust murdering people.\nMy name is Nick. On the streets, they call me, uh...\nSharky.\nSharky, that's right.\n'Cause I attack from beneath up.\nCece: It's all true, Camilla.\nAnd her name is not Reagan.\nIt's Suzi Shimizu.\nYou're Japanese?\nVery much so.\nWe happen... we happen to all be Japanese.\nThe unlucky offspring of a couple very lucky American GIs.\nUnnecessary backstory.\nYeah, they call me the Moyel on the streets, 'cause I will, uh... (clicks tongue) ...cut your penis off.\nIsn't that right, Sharky?\nYou're on your own, Moyel.\nAnd they call me Cece, but spelled S-I-S-I, with an accent over the last I.\nI am spinning out here, Moyel. You got to help me.\nWhy don't you go spin all the way over to your tree house?\nSchmidt knows about the tree house?\nOkay, what the hell is going on?\nWinston, check for a wire... she could be a rat.\nStop it. This isn't real.\nYou're telling us we're not a Japanese crime family?\nReagan, tell me the truth.\nReagan, seriously, just stop bailing.\nI'll just go.\nCamilla, wait.\nLook...\n(exhales)\nThis isn't working out.\nBut I think that it's my fault.\nBecause I don't let people in.\nI'm sorry.\nI think that you deserve a lot better than that.\nThank you.\nI know that wasn't easy for you.\nOkay, well, I'm gonna take off.\nDo you, um, still have my blue sweater?\nYes.\nOh, no, no, no...\nUh, it's right in my room. Right here, in the first door.\nRight there.\nOkay, thanks.\nWinston: Oh, no, no.\nNick: That's nice.\nTelling the truth works.\nSchmidt: Yeah, it did.\nCece: Good job.\nWait, wait, wait, wait for it.\nCamilla: Freaking bitch! (crashing)\nI hate you! I hate you so much!\nOh.\nYeah, it's the old \"I left my sweater\" trick.\n(Camilla roaring)\nLet me tell you something, folks, I've played that song before.\nAll right, well, this obviously turned out to be a huge disaster.\nI hate you so much!\nBut... thank you.\nTry sleeping on an upside down bed!\nI'm proud of you.\nAll of you... I mean, you guys could've bailed on me, but you didn't.\nYou stuck around, and you helped me lie to a psychotic woman who is now destroying all of my stuff.\n(Camilla yells)\nAnything to help.\nIt's kind of what we do.\nIt's how we roll.\n(Camilla shrieks)\nHow do you think she's taking it?\nWhat's with all these ribbons?!\nHow long do you think she's gonna be in there?\nI like to do about 15.\nCamilla: You are never gonna forget me!\nYou are never gonna forget Camilla!\nSo, what'd you bring us for dinner?\nCece: How about this one?\nAre you ready to... soak Mama's beans?\nIt's working, right?\nOkay, shh. I love you.\nYeah, I love you, too. I love you.\nLet's not talk.\nOkay.\n(grunting)\nNick!\nWhat?\nYou still can't eat in front of Reagan?\nThis has nothing to do with Reagan. I... I've just gotten used to eating in here. It's cozy.\nWhy, what are you guys up to?\nWhat?\n(knock at door)\nCan I come in? My room is trashed.\nThis is where we eat, right?\nYes, please, please, please.\nMight as well.\nI mean, sure, why not?\nWhat?\nI like the way you eat a burrito.\nThanks.\nYou're welcome.\n\u00a1Buenas noches!\n(Winston speaking Spanish)\nAah!\nOh!\nWinston!\nOh... oh...\nAll over the bed?!\nWinston: I didn't get my huevos on you, did I?\nClose your robe!\nOkay!\n"}, {"title": "05x08 - The Decision.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWell, that one diner has the best bacon.\nGreat bacon.\nSo I don't know.\nUgh, come on, guys. Please, God, we're entering minute 20 of the great brunch debate.\nThe other diner does have that special fruit cup.\nOther diner. Fruit cup. Let's go.\nHowever, when I think about it, huge crowd looking for that special fruit cup.\nSmart.\nSo now we got to think line versus bacon.\nPlease, I am starving.\nMake a decision. Oh, hi.\nDo you guys want to join us? We are going for brunch in seven days.\nHybrid meals are for people who are too lazy to wake up for a proper breakfast.\nBesides, we're looking for a wedding venue today.\nGood luck with these two, because if they get really hungry, then all bets are off.\nCurveball... maybe we roast a turkey.\nHave either of you ever made a decision in your lives?\nI make decisions all the time.\nDisrespectful.\nWhat's the last decision that you made?\nFirst of all, you got to make a decision if you gonna make a decision.\nYou know what I mean?\n(whistles, mimics explosion)\nOf course we make decisions. How do you think I'm wearing clothes right now?\nI laid those out for you, Nick.\nBut I decided to let you.\nThis is your whole problem. Imagine how much better your life would be if you could just make a decision.\nShe's just mad because she had a bunch of dumb brunch ideas, you damn fool. (laughs)\n(laughs)\nOkay. Uh, well, what about this? I will sleep with one of you tonight if you can just decide who.\nAre you... are you serious?\nI mean, we're talking about a one-time thing and you can't get weird afterwards, but, yeah, I'm... down for, like, a fun half hour.\nAnd you would be there?\nYes.\nYou would physically be there?\nYes.\nCan it... be nice?\nWell, that's on you. Let me know by 9:00.\nWhat if we die before then?\nThere's not much I can do about that.\nOkay, you know what, you know what, we'll discuss this amongst ourselves. I mean, uh, nobody wants to see how the sausage is made, am I right?\nNo, they don't. To the sausage factory.\nWhat?\nThat's not what I meant.\nYeah. Let's go.\nAll right.\nThank you for the opportunity.\nGood luck with your decision.\n(door closes)\nAt what cost?\nOne sexual barracuda to another, I see what you're doing.\nYou're doing it for the story.\nYou want to see how deep the abyss goes.\nYou want to look that monster straight into the eye.\nMaybe it's so bad that it's good.\nBut it's not good. It's b... it's bad.\nCece: Okay, honey, calm down.\nShe's not actually gonna do it.\nNo, I'm trying to teach them a lesson.\nThis isn't an '80s summer camp movie.\nI'm not gonna sleep with somebody based on a bet.\nI'm just... I was just kind of playing along with the whole thing just in case they were listening at the door.\nSomething about \"summer camp moogie.\"\n\"Summer camp moogie.\"\nNo, no, no. I got nothing.\nThis isn't real, right?\nIt can't be. (laughs)\nI mean...\nI mean, it can't be.\nWhy would it be?\nBut on the off chance that it is, we need to take this extremely seriously.\nYou're absolutely right. Okay, okay. Well, what do you suggest?\n(sputters) We do a gentlemen's debate.\nA gentlemen's debate.\nWe calmly discuss who merits this opportunity and we come to a decision based off respect and politeness.\nI agree. So... please proceed, sir.\nThank you, sir.\nYou're welcome, sir.\n(chuckling)\nOkay.\nThe gentleman knows that I have a monster crush on Reagan.\nBut because this is such a powerful argument in my favor, I politely take it off the table.\nIn that case, the gentleman politely... thanks you.\nHmm. The gentleman was sure that the other gentleman would not be such a jerk and let his friend's dreams come true.\nPerhaps I'm not dealing with a gentleman at all.\nPerhaps I'm dealing with a dingus.\nDid you call me a dingus?\nYou're acting like a dingus.\nHow can I be a dingus when you're the damn dingus?\nYou're the dingus.

You ditched me when we were supposed to run away from home together.\nI built that raft for nothing!\nWe could do this all day, but I have actual feelings for her.\nI thought you said feelings were off the table.\nWell, I'm putting 'em back on the table.\nI'm gonna settle this right here, right now.\nDo it.\nCindy...\nNo.\n...De La Garza.\nOh.\nHuh, so look at me.\nLook at me. Let it affect you.\nYou knew I had a crush on Cindy De La Garza,\nand you Frenched her anyway.\n(gasps)\nFrenching! They're Frenching! They're Fren...\nChaperone!\nThey're Frenching! (shouts)\nI had dibs on her since the fifth grade, dude!\nIf I could un-French her, I would.\nYou owe me this.\nI knew that French was gonna haunt me.\nYou called dibs... and I screwed up.\nWhat you gonna say? What you gonna say?\nIt's you.\nOh, yes. Man, that girl better get ready for some kind, attentive lovemaking. Oh.\nHey, uh, have you guys seen my purple sweater?\nUh, no. And, by the way, we've made our decision.\nWow. That was fast. You have until 9:00.\nWe don't need it.\nYou'll be having Winston.\nThat's me. I'm Winston.\nGreat. Don't eat for two hours before. I'm really looking forward to it.\nBring your A-game, okay? Any previous injuries that I need to know about? Bring something to numb your mouth.\nOh. Look.\nThe sweater was in my hand the whole time.\nYou know, this woman requested my A-game.\nMy A-game. Maybe it's hopeless that I could even please this woman sexually. What am I thinking, Winston?\nJust focus on yourself. Concentrate on yourself sexually, Winston.\nNo, Winston, that is not your way.\nI just want to head off any discussion of what your way is.\nI'm so sorry. I'm just feeling a little insecure about my body and the way it is connected to my face.\nBishop... (sighs) you have nothing to worry about.\nReally?\nYeah.\nOkay. What's my best feature?\nInstant regret. Instant.\nThe second I said it, I was like...\nIf you had to pick.\nFine.\nYou have very nice...\nThat's our suspect. He's taking off!\nWhat?\nOkay.\n(siren wailing)\nOkay, I'll let you take point on this one, because I got to protect my duke for later.\nOh, you suck so much.\nHas that park always been a pet cemetery or were just crazy people burying a dog there?\nWell, I'm not even close to giving up.\nWhy don't we just pop in here?\nOh, really? We just \"happened\" upon The Lisbon, Schmidt?\nPurely a coincidence that we... made it just on time for the appointment that I made a month ago.\nWhy are you doing this to yourself?\n(classical music playing)\nAh. Mr. Schmidt.\nMay I offer you a beverage?\nPerhaps an organic cucumber vodka spritzer?\nYes.\nIt is so beautiful. I feel like I'm inside Cate Blanchett.\nWe get that a lot.\nI've got to say, I'm pretty impressed with how quickly you guys came to that decision.\nWell, that's 'cause you don't know how mature we are.\nYou see, Winston had dibs on Cindy De La Garza since the fifth grade, I Frenched her in the eighth grade, so...\nSo about 20 years ago Winston had a three-year-old dib, he never acted on it, and now you're the bad guy?\n(laughs): Oh, Reagan.\nFirst of all, dibs can't be singular...\nI mean, if anything, it's kind of a story about how indecisive Winston can be.\nWell, no, it's a story about...\nBut you guys came to a decision... I'm proud of you.\nUh, can I... can I practice my presentation on you?\nSure. But I'm bored already.\nOkay.\nThis stuff's really boring for me.\nFor everybody, I guess.\nHmm.\nHepatitis C can be a long... arduous experience.\nBut now discover Zilpoza from Wudai Pharmaceuticals.\nFDA approval... pending double-blind study.\nIf you've had cirrhosis or kidney disease, Zilpoza... may not... be right...\n(whispers): for... you.\n(laughing)\nYou think I'm a 13-year-old boy?\nI know what you're doing.\nWhat am... what am I doing?\nYou're trying to lead me on, and I won't have it.\nCase closed! You're having Winston!\nGreat, I'm having Winston.\nUh...\nMm.\n(exhales)\nIt's so juvenile, what you're doing.\nA dib is a dib.\nOh, God, if I keep looking at the ceiling, I'm gonna cry.\nDamn it, we are getting sucked in... we have to leave immediately.\nIt's probably not even available.\nThere's no way, right? I mean...\nYou're right.\n(chuckles) Philip.\nHmm? Quick question.\nLook, we realize that you guys book up decades in advance, so please just let us know that you don't have any slots available.\nActually, you're in luck... Shia LaBeouf had to cancel his solitaire tournament, and we have one open slot, in April.\n(quiet groan)\nIn April?\nMm-hmm.\nAll right, babe, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\nYou need to breathe. We're just gonna enact the plan that we set up for when you see an ankle boot you really, really, really like, right?\nWhat do we do? We walk away...\nAnd if I dream about it in the middle of the night, then it's meant to be.\nWe're gonna walk away, Philip.\nThank you so much for all your help.\nI should let you know, however, there is another interested party.\nBenjamin (laughs): What? Schmittyballs?\nB... B-Benjamin.\nOkay.\nSchmidt: You're engaged?\nHmm.\nMazel to you, sir.\nHey, Meems, this is the, uh, fat guy from school we used to make dance for chocolate.\nMimi: Oh.\nSchmidt: In all fairness, uh, Benjamin would peg chocolate at my head while I was already dancing.\nHe what?\nBenny-boo, I don't want to lose The Lisbon to these fat people.\nThe hell?\nDon't worry, Schmidtstain can't afford The Lisbon.\nOh.\nUnless, of course, they accept gift certificates from fat camp.\nBenjamin, I still... I mean... I can...\nDo they do that? I'm a different...\nWe'll have to ask somebody about that.\nOkay, that is it!\nWe... are booking The Lisbon.\nWe are?\nGo!\nNo.\n\n\n\nI've never loved you more, Cece!\nWhat were you gonna say?\nWhat is that in reference to?\nIt's been silent for 30 minutes.\nEarlier, you were gonna tell me what my best feature was, and then we got distracted.\nRight. By crime.\nI could tell you what yours is.\nOh, my God, please don't.\nYou have a lovely neck.\nReally?\nNot my knuckles or, like, the skin behind my ears?\nOkay, do me. It's my turn.\nCome on, come on, come on, come on, I need this.\nFine.\nI will tell you, but then we drop it immediately and forever.\nDrop.\nYou have kind eyes.\nReally?\nMm-hmm.\nI have kind eyes.\nI'll take that.\nYou know, I always thought I had snail eyes.\n\"Immediately and forever,\" remember?\nI'll turn around.\nTurn around.\nI-I'll save my kind eyes for last.\nOkay.\n(phone buzzing)\nHello?\nI'm reopening the Reagan decision.\nWait, what?\n(quietly): I already took my supplements.\nI know. I'm sorry. I'm telling her we've decided, and it was me.\nOh, no, you are not! I hear shaving.\nAre you shaving?\nNo!\nI know what that means.\n(phone beeps) Hello? Hello, Nick?\n(whispers): Damn.\nJust go.\nYou mean it?\nThank you very much, Aly.\nI am going to win this sex bet!\nWe want to get married at The Lisbon.\nWe want to book The Lisbon right now!\nUh, start by filling these forms out.\nIt'll be pleasure.\nYeah, no problem.\nCece: What's our routing number?\n69364278.\nJust gonna give Benjamin a little coffee... oh, I'm so sorry.\nHey, come on, she can't do that.\nNo, no, she did that. I'm so sorry.\nYeah.\nOh, wow.\nThe service is so gorgeous.\nReally great.\nYou do realize we're not gonna decide this on who writes the fastest.\nYou know, here at The Lisbon, we celebrate grandeur, romance.\nOh, you are Schmidt out of luck, Schmidt.\nOur wedding's gonna be sick romantic.\nOur wedding's gonna be way romantic, bro.\nQuiches so small you got to wear glasses.\nBitch, we're gonna have more white linen than a hospital in the Great War.\nYeah, we're gonna have so many fresh cut flowers that you're gonna have a real bee problem up in this bitch.\nWe're gonna have spanakopita so flaky, you're gonna get crumbs all over your mouth, like, what?\nOur tables are gonna be names of cities that we've been to, like, what?\nOur wedding is gonna be so... big... that the Giants will come to town and everyone gets a big spoon.\nPhilip, you-you want romance?\nLet me tell you the story about how I knew that Mimi was the one for me.\nThe story is called \"Lovestruck.\"\nSchmidt: There's a title?\nIt was our fourth date, and we had just seen Toy Story 3 for the second time.\nMaybe it's just us, but we love Pixar.\nBenjamin: We're nerds.\n(Mimi giggles)\nI reach for Mimi's hand, and I was struck by lightning.\nI mean, literally, I was struck Yeah. Zap. by a bolt of lightning, Philip, and I... I would've been killed if Mimi hadn't grounded me.\nWe met... crying (chuckles) over the same name at the Vietnam Memorial.\nGeorge...\nHarrison...\nFord.\nWha...?\nWho was our grandfather.\nSchmidt: What? Making us cousins?\nMaking us cousins, because there is nothing more romantic than forbidden love.\nBetween family members? I mean, that's...\nYou're gonna double down with that?\nYes, I am.\nHe's writing \"cousins\" down.\nCece: That's a positive thing.\nNo, it's not.\nHey. What are you doing, man?\nWe had a decision.\nThe decision wasn't valid... your dib on Cindy was expired.\nOkay, first of all dibs don't expire.\nAlso, dibs... not singular.\nAnd how are you still shaving?\nI'm doing full body, Winston.\nI started from the bottom, now I'm here.\nThat's gross.\nI've been doing sex prep all day.\nI did a hundred girl push-ups.\nI washed my feet until the water ran clear.\nYou can clean your feet all damn day... it don't matter, because I'm having sex with Reagan tonight.\nThe decision's been made.\nWell, the decision's been changed... I'm having sex with Reagan.\nThat's not gonna happen.\nIt is gonna happen.\nNow, if you'll excuse me...\nNo, don't...\nGot it!\nWhat were you going for?\nThe cologne.\nI smell so pretty!\nGive me... give me my col...\n(grunts) No. No, no, no. No.\n(spitting)\nOh, God! Aah!\n(grunts) What are you doing!\nI don't know, man!\nYou got frickin' cologne all over me.\nI smell fantastic!\nOh, my God.\nWe got to turn the tables on Reagan, make her decide.\nI don't see her going for it, man... the entire point was that we had to make a decision.\nWell, then I guess we're gonna have to trick her, and I know how.\nWe'll up your fee by $10,000.\nTen thousand and one dollar!\nUh, Cece, we don't have $10,000. We barely have the one.\nTen thousand and two dollars!\nIt's not your turn to bid.\n$15,000!\n$15,000...\nIt's not... it's not... it's not worth it.\nIt's not worth it. Yeah, but it's your dream.\nI... I know.\nBut I already have my dream.\nIt's marrying you.\nIt's all yours, Benjamin.\nYes! (giggles)\nBenjamin: \"I have my dream.\"\nDumb!\nMimi: They remind me of my stupid grandparents on their 60th anniversary.\n(laughs) Old.\n(murmuring)\nReagan.\nLet me guess. You guys made a final decision?\nPlease. Sit.\nThat's probably the first time you've been right all day, but yes, we have made a decision.\nGreat.\nWinston: Here's the deal, Reagan.\nIt's 2016, you're a lady.\nYour decision is important to us.\nYes, we want you to decide which one of us is most attractive to you, and if that person is the same name that's on the piece of paper in this envelope, then sexual relations can commence.\nOkay, well, the logic is bulletproof.\nI just feel like if I'm gonna be making this decision, I need you guys to pitch yourselves.\nFor starters, I'm completely hairless, Okay. except for a straggler near one of my nipples, because I got scared while shaving.\nIn my fantasies, I'm a wild lover.\nIn real life, my sexual prowess has been described as \"fine,\" \"adequate.\"\n\"It'll get the job done.\"\nThat is both a lot and a little, but either way, a tough act to follow.\nWinston, you're up.\nWell, that's easy.\nI've got kind eyes.\nNick: You don't have kind eyes.\nYou have snail eyes. Everybody knows that.\nI've got kind eyes. Aly told me so.\nWho's Aly?\nYeah, she's my partner at work. I complimented her first, told her she had a very nice neck, which she does.\nBut what I should have said was, \"You got a really cool chin,\" or \"You got some dope earlobes.\"\nHonestly, everything about her is great.\nAnd when I'm with her, I never really notice time.\nIt's probably because she is the best part of my day.\nI should... I should have told her one of those things, as opposed to the neck thing, you know.\nThen she told me I had kind eyes.\nYou like Aly.\nYes.\nShe's my partner.\nNick: Winston!\nCome on, it's obvious. You like Aly.\nI-I like her. I-I like Aly.\nOh, my goodness!\nWhy did I never think of that before?\nWow, my mouth is dry.\nAnybody else's mouth dry?\nWhat should I do? I don't know what to do.\nI don't know what to do. What should I do?\nWinston, this is Cindy De La Garza all over again.\nYou need to make a decision.\nI got to ask her out.\nGood! Go!\nGo ahead! Go! Good luck!\nListen, Reagan, I am so sorry, but obviously, we will not be making love tonight.\nNo. It's not fair.\nI'm sorry.\nI got to go.\nWell, I guess that leaves just old Nick Miller.\nMm. Your room or my room?\nHmm?\nWell, both rooms have a lot of interesting possibilities.\nMm-hmm.\nThat's a heck of a question.\nYour, um...\nGive me 15 minutes, and I'm gonna come back and tell you which room and why from my opinion, and then, you can give me yours, and we can discuss.\nJust give me one second, and, uh, I'll be good to go.\nI just need... two minutes tops.\nStay there.\n(grunts)\nOh.\nOh! Aw, no!\nOh, that's a lot of blood.\nOh.\nDamn.\n(sighs)\nWell, you're back, and you have an insane look in your eyes, so... congratulations?\nNo, I didn't do it.\nI was, uh... You know, I thought about it.\nOh, I don't need to know.\nUh, yeah.\nYeah...\nWould you like to go out after work, grab a drink with me?\nSure.\nSure. (laughs)\nAll right then. (laughs)\nOh. Uh, can my boyfriend come?\nYour boyfriend? Yeah.\nYeah, sure! (clears throat)\nHow long have you guys been...?\nYeah, it's new.\nIt's new. It's new. It's...\nHe's an agent, actually, for... animal actors?\nWhat am I gonna say? No.\nHe should stay at home and not exist, please.\n(laughs) No, I won't say that.\nOfficer down... to meet your boyfriend.\nI realize those were a poor choice of words for a station.\nReagan: Nick!\nIt's almost 9:00. Are we doing this or what?\nWhat is that?\nYou look like you're in a Boca Raton street gang.\nI didn't think you were actually gonna go through with it, and even if you were...\nI made a decision.\nI wouldn't want it like this.\nSo I decided to put on my I'm-not-having-sex tonight outfit, 'cause no one's gonna have sex with me in this outfit.\nAnd now I'm gonna go out and have a drink.\nWould you like to come?\nWow. Deciding Nick.\nLet me change.\nNick: FYI... your I'm-not-having-sex-tonight outfit is leopard print and tight.\nI don't know if you know that.\nIt's animal print, but it's not tight.\nThese are baggy, fuzzy PJs with a flap on the butt.\nExactly my point. You want to see what's in the envelope?\nIt's a blank sheet of paper.\nYou're so wrong.\nDoes that look like a blank sheet of paper?\nVery clever.\nThanks, yeah. I thought of it when I was getting tickets to the World Series of Chili and had to prove that I was human.\nOoh, ooh.\nWe've got big news, you guys.\nChampagne all around.\nWe're getting married in a...\nBoth: soon-to-be-abandoned warehouse!\nYeah. Champagne.\nOh, thank you.\nAnd I'll even give you one.\nHey, guys, Aly is on her way to the bar.\n(cheering)\nWith her boyfriend.\nOh, that's the worst.\nWell, you know, everyone dies. Maybe he'll die.\nI'm sorry, Winston.\nIs there anything we can do to cheer you up?\nUh, no.\nAnything that would make you feel better?\nAnything?\nAnything?\nWell, if you insist, then.\nYou asked me what I wanted. This is all want.\nAll right, let's do it, let's do it. Let's just do it. Let's do it.\nAll:  Motown \n Philly's back again \nNow slower.\n(slowly):  With a little \n East coast fling \nWinston: Slower...\n"}, {"title": "05x09 - Heat Wave.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nReporter: A record heat wave is melting Los Angeles, sparking chaos in stores across the Southland.

We've got a combination of cool winds, a-a cool, chilly pond, you wear white jeans 'cause they don't absorb heat... that's actually science, I did research.\nYou know, science aside, man, you working those jeans. Oh, thanks for saying that, man.\nI was insecure about the way they looked.\nYou killing it, man.\nHey, guys. How are you doing?\nWell, everything here looks normal.\nWelcome to The Ranch.\nI don't know what that means.\nHave a seat.\nReagan: Why would I do that?\nNick: It'll cool you right off.

Is that chair supposed to be wet?\nIt is.\nI...\nOkay.\nAnd away we... cool!\n(laughing): Check it out!\nFeels like somebody is learning to whistle very close to my face.\nThat's right, it does.\nShe said it feels like someone's whistling close to her face!\nI never thought of that.\nIt's another plus.\nNo.\nNo, it's not.\nBut I have a better idea.\nWhy don't we all cool off... with the brand-new air conditioner that I bought?\nSon of a...\nYes!\nWhat?\nWhat?\nA/C!\nOh...\nDamn.\nCece: Oh, it was so hot.\nOh, yeah, this is wet.\nCece: Having A/C.\nThat's sweat from my bottom.\n\nSchmidt: This is amazing.\nThank you, Reagan. Finally, we can stop living like people in a beer commercial before the beer shows up.\nHow did you pull this off?\nIt's not a big deal. That whole riot thing's really overblown.\nGet the hell back!\n(screams)\nI will be putting the A/C in my room and everyone is welcome.\nNo, thank you. We're good.\nI speak for all of us.\nReagan: Okay.\nWell, we are observing gym rules, so make sure you wipe down anything you plan to sit on.\nWhatever.\nMore breeze for us.\nI'm gonna grab some old underpants and I'll put a pair in the freezer for each of you.\nTrust me, I'm wearing frozen underwear right now, and I feel amazing.\n(crackling)\nSo, I'm in good shape.\nCece?\nMmm.\nI think maybe you should go... go hang out by the A/C.\nCece's got a big audition today to be a reporter.\nShe's been taking broadcasting classes.\nAny way you slice it, that cafeteria pizza is a great deal.\nYou know, in fact, I'm getting a little hungry myself.\nHow about you, Carl?\nI thought the next thing I was supposed to talk about was the rain.\nIt is, Carl.\nI was just having a little banter.\nOh.\nUm...\nI... uh, I had a sandwich so... I'm full.\nThe audition's just for gas station TV, okay?\nNobody watches it.\nWinston: Don't you dare downplay it.\nI adore gas station television, I mean, myself, personally.\nIt is the intersection between information and also gas.\nThat's right. Cece, today it's gas, tomorrow, it's local news... the next thing you know, you're reporting diabetes statistics as we all watch B-roll of fat people walking across the street.\nI just, I don't...\nI-I don't think I'm gonna go to the audition.\n'Cause it's... it's just so hot.\nYou know?\nOkay.\nUm...\nYeah, I mean, that's-that's cool.\nJust... Look, I love you no matter what.\nGo cool off.\nAll right.\nAll right.\nCan I talk to you for a second?\nWhat the hell was all that coddling?\nWhoa.\nWhat are you, a big-bosomed grandma?\nTough love! Make her go!\nDon't tell me what to do!\nI'm her fianc\u00e9, not some schnook off the street eating a peanut butter cookie.\nIt's my job to give her love and support.\nThat's how I get her to go to the audition.\nAs a cop, do you think I would get anyone to do anything if I were being kind and supportive?\nHell no!\nLook, I have recently found my cop voice and I'll tell you this: it is very effective.\nIs that what you've been practicing in the bathroom?\n(loud): Everybody stop!\nMake a left turn!\n(high, wavering): You have the right to remain silent!

It feels great.\nOh, Nick... you're gonna make a great dad.\nI'll see you later.\nOkay.\nHey! Who needs him, huh?\nYeah.

Good Samaritan just collapsed.\nOh!\nAnd UPS guy to the rescue!\n(thudding) And the UPS guy just collapsed.\nAh, lady stealing packages...\nAh...\n(thudding) Oh! And the lady just collapsed.\nWhoo. You know, I'm actually kind of getting chilly in here.\nLook, guys.\nI got this box of Jess's weird old ski clothes.\nOh!\nOoh...\nHello, 1989.\nWinston: Check me out, I'm Picabo Street.\nYou know who that is, right?\nI don't know who that is.\nReal apr\u00e8s-ski vibe.\nI feel like I'm in Gstaad.\nGstaad's all about apr\u00e8s-ski.\nWell, it's nice in the summer, too.\nOh, have you been?\nHave you?\nHave you?\nHave you been, is the real question.\nHave-have you been to Gstaad?\nWh... I...\nWhat does it matter? Just tell the truth.\nHave you been there? Have you been there?\nI'm sorry, have you?\nNo, I haven't been there.\nWell... (laughs)\nShould I be ashamed of that, or can we all just tell the truth about whether we've been to... \"Shtaad.\"\nPlease. It's \"Gstaad.\"\nShaad.\nShtaad.\nNo one in this room has been to Gstaad.\nYeah, one more fan.\nJust a little closer.\nOkay, that'll do it.\nYou guys are suckers in there! This is great!\nShould we be worried about him?\nWorried about Nick? Oh, no, this is just what he does.\nOkay, but being exposed to the heat for that long is actually super-dangerous, so... maybe I should go reason with him.\n(others laughing)\n\"Reason.\"\nPlease excuse our immediate but correct response.\n(Nick grunts)\n(grunts)\nOh, hey, hey.\nPlease just come into my room? It's right there.\nIt's not even hot in reality.\nYou're obviously suffering from heat exhaustion.\nIt's like a crisp Vermont November.\nApple cider, football weather.\nDon't jump in a pile of leaves.\n(chuckling): There might be a dead dog in there.\nYou're slurring your speech.\nSoon you're gonna get dizzy, you're gonna get cramps.\nWhy do you care so much, Reagan?\nBecause you look like a dying man on a hospital show.\nOh, I know why.\nBecause you have a crush on me.\nNo.\n(laughs) Yeah.\nThat's... that...\nI... You're... you're a human being and I'm worried about... You have a crush on me.\nNo. That's why you're always thinking about me...\nThat has nothing to do with that.\n... giving me my medicals, checking on me, giving me my medicals...\nYou said that twice. You are hallucinating.\nNo, Reagan, I'm \"ha-truth-inating.\"\nOkay, you know what, I'm gonna have to smoke you out.\nOoh-hoo! Smoke me out?\nTurn 'em all on, great.\nI love it hot.\nNick: Great, turn 'em up.\nI got the sticks if you got the melons.\nMarsh-melons.\nMarshmallows.\nSorry.\n\n\n\n\n(imitates whooshing)\n(laughing): Hey, Deborah.\nHey, Cece, now that... now that we're...\nWhat?\nNow that we're in the cool, have you rethought the audition?\nMaybe you'll go now?\nI mean, either way I love you, I just...\nUm, no.\nNo, okay.\nMm-mm.\nOkay, I still love you though.\n(whispering): You leave me with no choice.\n(whispering): What are you doing?\nMa'am! I'm gonna ask that you please remove your headphones now!\nWhat?\nDo you know why I asked you to remove your headphones?\nWhy are you talking so loud?\nDo you have a cranberry stuck in your ear again?\nWinston found his cop voice.\nOh...\nMa'am! Why are you avoiding an audition when you know damn well it's important to you?\nDon't do this. Get back in your vehicle, immediately!\nMa'am, please answer the question.\nWhy are you avoiding an audition?\nAnd do not say that you are not, because I know that you are, so tell me why!\nWhy?! Why?!\nWhy?!\nNow, damn it, speak!\nWhat if I'm not good enough?\nIt's my dream job, and what if I can't do it, okay?\nWhat?\nCece, you're the most talented...\nSir, stand down!\nWinston, you stand down.\nGo play softball against the fire department or whatever it is you do.\nThat's not till Wednesday.\nHoney, I was terrified.\nDon't worry... don't...\nMy hands are shaking. Block that out.\nI'm freaking out. Yeah.\nBlock that out.\nSchmidt: Okay, let's plan a trip.\nSomething to look forward to.\nYeah, that'd be great.\nMother freckles.\nWinston's wild.\nCece: God, that was so scary.\nIt was so terrible.\nIt's okay.\n(grunting)\nCan you just admit that it's hot in here?\nThere's no way that you are not hot. I'm hot.\nWhy are you so worried about old Nicky pots and pans?\nI don't have a crush on you.\nYou have a crush on me, it's obvious.\nWhy would I have a crush on you?\nYou are the most stubborn, annoying, frustrating person I have ever met in my entire life.\nWhy don't you tell that to the judge in your pants?\nVerdict's in. You're guilty.\nWhere are you going?!\nI'm shutting down your ranch.\nLeave my ranch out of it!\nWell, then I'm gonna do this, you idiot.\nWhoa.\nNo, don't.\nLeave it alone.\nReagan: Stop.\nReagan: No, you don't...\n(beeping) (beeping)\nWhat is going on?!\nDamn! Damn!\nReagan, please, let...\nLook, she's the one...\nWh... No, you're the one.\nSchmidt: Now, get down to the basement and fix our power.\nBut the basement? There are so many rats.\nShe'll probably try to make out with me.\nPlease, I would rather make out with a rat.\nGross. Did you hear what she just said?\nStop! Go to the basement and stay there until the power is fixed!\nYes, sir.\n(bell dinging)\nNow, I have accidentally pressed all of the buttons, but you will stay on the elevator until you get to the basement!\nAnd when you get to that basement... Aw, damn...\nHow is it even hotter down here Because the heat stays low, you dummy.\nIt's bad enough that we're down here, I can't explain science to you.\nI hope that the Chicago Cubs win the World Series while you're in a coma.\nThat's one of the meanest things anybody has ever said to me.\nWe are visitors, let's act like it.\nHello, rats?\nHello?! (grunts)\nI come to hurt ya.\nOkay, for those who have not been scared off, I actually come in peace.\nMy name is Nick.\nI've been down here a lot.\n(high-pitched): Hello, Nicholas.\nI'm Jeremiah.\nSorry.\nWhy would you... ?\nIt's funny.\nVery clever.\nYou got really scared.\nI'm not so scared, but don't ever do that again.\nIt's also a very good rat voice.\nThank you But it is a terrible rat name.\nJeremiah? That would never be the name of a rat.\nIt's name is, like, Sushi.\nOr \"Ma-cushi.\"\nNow, follow me.\nI want to leave one set of footprints.\nThat is a perfect plan, but I'm not going to do that.\n\nOh, hello, old friend.\nFunny seeing you here.\nTick-tock.\nAlmost audition time.\nHey, Cece.\nHuh?\nYou know that thing you said before about you not being talented enough?\nYou didn't mean that, right?\n(laughing): Yeah, I did.\nNewscasters are amazing.\nBut so are you.\nCome on, Schmidt, okay?\nI'm a bartender and a model.\n(Southern accent): Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle.\n(quietly): Yes, do it, baby.\n\"Vehicle\"? What vehicle?\nThe metaphorical vehicle that is holding you back.\nOh.\nDon't explain yourself. Just go with it.\nYou are a brilliant, amazing woman, who is capable of anything.\nOkay, maybe drop the Southern accent.\n(New York accent): What, you got mozzarell in your ears?\nYou're, uh, get out of your own way, lady, huh?\nUh, tr-try, Law & Order... uh, Hargitay.\nI've got a past and it affects my job.\nAnd my relationships... I can't really do a Mariska.\nWhat is happening here?\nCece, I know the audition is scary for you.\nI would not be doing my job as the man who loves you if I let you walk away from this.\nDon't blow it, Cece!\nYou are not walking away from this opportunity!\nOkay...\nI'm gonna need less talking out of you and more action, damn it!\n(quietly): Wow.\nWait, no, Cece, I'm sorry.\nDid I take it too far?\n(door opens)\nI took it too far, didn't I? Oh, God.\nIt's fine.\nI have been down this road many a-times.\nShe's gonna come walking back through that door in three, two...\n(chuckles)\nLook, Schmidt, not for nothing, man, you got so many good characters inside of you.\n(chuckles): Oh, my gosh.\nDid you already bind the 120s?\nYeah, this should do it.\nDo what? (scoffs) Cook you like barbecue chicken?\nI traced it back. It's fine.\nI wouldn't do that if I were you.\nIt's not safe.\nCan you admit that I might actually be right about something for once?\nIt's your own funeral; you win.\nGreat.\nDon't do it!\nNick!\nFine, let's just say you are right.\nThen at least let me do it, okay?\nYou don't have to do that.\nI want to do it.\nI mean, I don't, like, want to do it, obviously, but... \n(stammers) What if I'm wrong?\nIf you think this is right, it's probably right.\nYou've been, you've been right about a lot of stuff today.\nLike what? What else was I right about?\nJust a lot of stuff. I don't want to talk about what you were actually right about at this moment. Okay, ready?\nUh...\nIf I get burned up and die this way, it would be such an embarrassing way to go.\nBut what would be nice about it is that I would technically have been right.\nHere we go.\nHeroes don't wear capes.\nNo, no, no...\n(whirring)\nThose sons of bitches did it.\n(chuckling)\nHey, great!\nReally good.\nThat was really great.\n(whispers): What are you looking at?\nHuge... rat.\n(squeaking)\n(screaming)\n(screaming) No! No! No!\nThis is my nightmare!\n(people shouting indistinctly)\nIt's time.\n(grunting)\nHow did I... ?\nDid you carry me out like a firefighter?\nNo, you woke up right away.\nAnd then you were like, \"Ooh, I need some fresh air.\"\nSo we came outside, I bought you a muffin and then you passed out again.\nOh, yeah, I remember that muffin.\nI feel like you had a pretty bad shock, so let's ask a few questions.\nWhat day of the week is it?\nThat's not something I typically know.\nI would guess Monday.\nOkay.\nBlackout.\nATM's are down.\nCash is king and batteries is queen.\nWhat? Stop being so whimsical, Winston.\nCece still hasn't called me back.\n(sighs)\nI think I pushed her too far.\nNo, Schmidt, you did the right thing, man.\nLook, people get mad at police officers because we tell them what they don't want to hear.\nYet, everyone loves police officer...\n(horns honking)\n(deep voice): Hey, it's a blackout, not the Rapture!\nYou yield!\nAll right!\n(people shouting)\nHey, hey, hey, sir, sir!\nKeep it moving!

You really pissed me off.\nI wrote something rude on your car.\nIt was that stupid cop voice.\nI shouldn't have pushed you that hard.\nNo, you should've.\n'Cause you were right.\nI was chickening out.\nSo I went.\nYou did?\nMm-hmm.\nWell, that's amazing. How did it go?\nReal bad. Yeah.\nIt went real bad?\nOkay, well, you know what? about it, baby, I'm sure...\nNo, no, no, no. They just didn't...\nIt was, it was legitimately terrible but not because I'm not talented.\nI went to the bar first so I was wasted and wearing shorts, which I won't do next time.\n(both laugh)\nThank you for pushing me.\nWe need to do that kind of thing for each other.\nYes, please.\nI agree, unless, of course, it's about me using face wash all over my body.\nAh, this again, really?\nI don't care that it's expensive.\nI know that you don't care.\nI'm just gonna keep on doing it.\n(music playing)\nOh, ice cream truck! Oh!\nRight this way!\nHere we go, sir. Here we go, sir.\nHere we go, sir. All right, stop!\n(music playing)\nIce cream, man, open up.\nWhere the ice cream at?\nCan I buy you some ice cream?\nFirst, uh, I just want to revisit that little moment in the basement where you were like, \"Hey, Reagan, you've been right about a lot of stuff today.\"\nReally?\nI just want you to specifically tell me what You are out of control. I've been right about.\nYou're a grown man.

I understand that.\nI mean, you're-you're beautiful, and-and you're smart, and you're-you're mean, but in a hot way.\nAnd-and you have the-the mind of a electrician, which is so confusingly hot, because that is not, like, a sexy...\n We could both be stars \n Yeah, who knows? \n We could fall apart \n Yeah, who knows? \n Who knows? \n\n All the things that we wanna be \nExcuse me, is your name Stephanie?\nI'm supposed to be meeting somebody here.\nIt's Nick.\nSo, no Stephanie.\nHey, yo, Nick, you coming, man?\n All that we do is, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh \nGreat.\n Follow the world as it goes... \nWhat is this, a frozen banana, Winston?\nOkay.\nWhile you're gassing up, let's look at the stock merkins.\nMarts...

The 800 pounds, that goes with the gorilla thing.\n800 pounds is not a very big elephant.\nJess! Reagan and I were romantic together.\nOoh.\nI didn't know that.\nWhich means I've been romantic with both of you.\nCool.\nAnd it's not just because you have brown hair and you've shared this room.\nBut because you're great, top-shelf ladies.\nAnd I had the opportunity, and so I reached in the cookie jar, and I grabbed a chocolate chip and an oatmeal.\nAnd I'm not saying who's who.\n(sighs) I've gotten off-track.\nYour worlds must be turned absolutely upside down.\nThis must be devastating, as it is to me.\nWe're all feeling emotions we couldn't even begin to discuss.\nA lot of us are having bad anxiety, and our legs are feeling weird and tingly.\nI think we're fine with it.\nI think it's great.\nI'm really glad I came in here and, uh, talked about this.\nI feel like we've gotten a lot of...

Che was a relevant precedent.\nAlso he wheezed... a lot.\nLike the door of a haunted house.\nHe has asthma.\nWe can find that guy and see if he knows anything.\nI used to peddle inhalers. What color was his?\nOh, uh... red.\nLike the door of a haunted house!\nSorry. (laughs)\nThe only group excursion we took was to a haunted house.\nBy the way, if you like haunted houses but hate lines, January's a great time to go...\nDr. Foley?\nReagan Lucas.\nI was just calling to ask you if you were still handing out samples of Ciliabreez?\nSix months after the recall?\nOh, dang.\nJim?\nNothing more bad-ass than calling a doctor by his first name.\n(shushing)\nSorry.\nAll I need from you is the name of a patient.\n(Digital Underground's The Humpty Dance playing)\nSchmidt: What is this, Winston?\nWho are all these unusual people?\nWhere's the instructor?\nIt is a gathering, not a class.\nI've told you that before.\nListen, it's fun.\nThat's not dancing. These people aren't dancing.\nDancing is about precision and domination and sweat.\nCheck out my ass. Check out my ass!\nMy butt is alive! (whoops)\n(dancers clamoring)\nSchmidt: We're not gonna learn our first dance here.\nI'm gonna call my Beijing Opening Ceremonies contact.\nHe's fantastic.\nNo, no, no.\nLook, I always imagined that our first dance would just be you and me having the time of our lives.\nVery choreographed time of our lives.\nNo.\nHaving fun... that's how I want to start our lives together.\nCan you please just try?\nPlease?\nYeah, I'll-I'll-I'll try.\nJust listen to the music.\nLet it build.\nLet it build.\nGot to let it wash over you...

It's happening.\nWell, just teach me the steps and I'd be happy to join in.\nThere are no steps.\nWhat dance are you guys doing?\nBecause it is not Humpty's!\n This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name... \nThis is his dance, y'all!\nAnd Humpty Hump is his name!\nDuring Cece's first wedding, Nick and I went into a duct to catch a badger that Winston had released.\nNaturally.\nIt was crazy!\nIt was chaotic!\nIt was largely Nick's fault.\nBut then I realized he's the only person I'd ever go into a duct with.\nNick kind of sneaks up on you.\nYou think he's one thing... and then...\nYeah, Nick is great.\nBut I'm leaving and we're both cool about that so...\nOh, right, you're both totally cool about it.\nI get Goosebumps Walka... Okay, okay, just think... okay.\nOh, wait, Reagan, before you go!\nWherever the fridge of life takes you...\nYou came in, I liked you, then you left!\nWhat, what is that...?!\nStop thinking... that this is good-bye.\nAnd start knowing it as... bye... bye.\nPretend I didn't do the byes.\n\nReagan: So, Dr. Foley says our guy spends all of his time here.\nWith all this grass, no wonder his asthma is bad.\nJess: Oh, hey!\nThere he is!\nHey, 9C!\nOh, no. No, no, no, no, no!\nYou do not run my life anymore. Good-bye!\nIs that adult man afraid of you?\nI take a bathroom break when I want to!\nI cracked skulls as foreman.\nWhoa, whoa.\nJess: Men only?!\nIt's 2016!\nClearly, I make the rules.\nThat's why my office is a hut.\nFine, we'll get a man.\nSo, Winston didn't answer.\nSchmidt said, They're desecrating the Time Warp.\nDesecrating it! And he hung up.\nBut I got a hold of Nick.\nHe said that he's super busy, which means he's naked and doodling.\nBut he said he'd make time for us, which is good.\nWait, sorry, so Nick is coming?\nYeah.\nNo, just call him and tell him not to come.\nI thought you were cool.\nI am cool.\nYou don't really seem cool.\nIt's just that when I see him, it's a, it's weird, Mm-hmm.\n'cause I'm, I'm leaving and it's, it's complicated.\nI do... I just, I don't really know how to...\nRight.\nGod, I'm crazy about him!\nYes! I knew it!\nI knew it.\nOkay, yes.\nThat's enough. You're right.\nYou know what happens now.\nI don't want to hug you.\nYou know what happens now!\nI'm not hugging you.\nYeah, you are.\nI'm not hugging you.\nYou know the other juror's name?\nI think it was 237B.\nWhat's that guy's name, yeah?\nOh, yeah, no.\nI really, really can't. It's like...\nNah...\nI like that guy, really?\nWhat's the name of the juror?\nNo!\nCalls hand sanitizer ham sanitizer.\nTell me the name and I'll give you the hat!\nQuit it! Quit it!\nHe calls DNA D and A.\nYou want grass stain on this white hat?!\nPlease no.\nBut he kisses you like a coal miner greeting his wife.\nAfter a day in the caves.\nDid they go into caves?\n237B is Gary Garcia!\nGary?\nI'm not jumping this! Let's go!\nYou get back here!\nGary Garcia!\nSchmidt: Look at her out there.\nTreating the laws of music as mere suggestions of music.\nMust be frightening to love a daredevil.\nWhat happened to you?\nGrowing up a husky boy, I learned that I had no margin for error.\n(Van McCoy's The Hustle playing)\nHey, fatty, it's called The Hustle.\n(laughter)\nSchmidt: The slightest mistake meant ridicule, so I had to learn to do everything perfectly.\nI learned to dance a dance the way that it was meant to be danced.\nAnd until I learned to dance that dance perfectly, I would never dance that dance.\n(shouts)\nAnd then exactly 364 days later...\n Do The Hustle! \n Do the Hustle... \nBoy: Sock it, man!\n(audience clamoring)\nGirl: Go!\n(cheering)\nBoy: Whoa!\nNo complaints here, fatty.\nNo complaints.\nLet me ask you a question about this mean kid at the talent show... was he a child emperor?\nNo, he was as poor and trashy as they come.\nSo he had no power over you then or now.\nSchmidt, you got to stop letting childish ridicule dictate your actions.\nOh, yeah, well, your-your smelly butt looks dumb in those pants.\n(cell phone rings)\nHello?\nWinston, I need you to run a name through the system.\nThat's a real thing, right?\nMale officer: Yeah, nice vest!\n(whistling)\nHey, look, Bishop altered his uniform again.\n(laughter)\nPoor guy.\nIt's a bloodbath.\nHe'll live.

Do I, uh...?\nDo you go left, right or backwards?\nLeft, le... uh, left!\nNick.\nUh, right, right.\nBackwards.\nLeft is a great choice.\n'Cause that's what I started with.\nLeft is a great choice.\nThank you, man.\nThat's, that was my instinct, left.\nAnd I would read that one.\nThat's 'cause this is a perfect one.\nWhen are you gonna tell him how you feel?\nNever. I'm still leaving.\nWhat would be the point of telling him how I feel when nothing can possibly come from it?\nWinston: So... there are 28 guys named Gary Garcia.\nGreat, I can do that.\nThat's not bad. - Really?\nOn that piece of paper.\n931 in the system; still printing.\nAre you sure that Gary didn't have something distinctive about him?\nJust a smile big and wide, like the door of a haunted house.\nBoy, was I wrong. Gary Garcia.\nIn my mind, he was Lawrence from Torrance.\nIn your wildest fantasies, he lives in Torrance?\nLawrence from Torrance, not Lawrence of Torrance.\nHe was born in Torrance, but now he lives in Brentwood.\nLawrence of Brentwood.\nKind of sounds like the sponsor at the end of a game show.\nYeah. Pat Sajak's wardrobe furnished by Lawrence of Brentwood.\nYeah.\n(giggles)\nThis is why you should tell Nick how you feel.\nEven if nothing comes of it.\nSo you won't end up like me.\nI never told Gary how I feel, and now I never can.\nYou can, and you should.\nDon't let Miller become your Garcia.\nHi, Nick.\nI want to say something to you before we say good-bye.\nShh...\nEw.\nSayonara, Sammy.\nSayonara.\nWhat?\nThat's the shower.\n(whispering): I know it is.\nHello and good morning.\nHello and good morning.\nYou okay?\nIt's not so bad if I don't think about the trial.\nTrial, trial, trial, trial...\n\nHello and good morning!\nToday, more on that trial that's been captivating Los Angeles.\nJoining us is the trial's foreman.\nThank you for being here, ma'am.\n(distorted voice): Thank you for having me, Alan; I'm a big fan.\nAlan: Also with us, via satellite, is another member of the jury.\nNo way it's him!\nWinston: Whoa...\nWhat are the odds?\nWell, exactly one in 11, Nick.\nJuror...\n(distorted voice): Please, please, oh, my God, please.\n...237B.\n(distorted shriek)\nOh! - Oh! - Oh!\nAlan: Welcome, sir.\n(distorted voice): It's good to be with you, Alan.\nLet's start...\nGary!

Principal Cavatappi.\nLike I always say: don't call me Becky unless you're riding me like a horse.\n(laughs)\nWe work in a middle school.\nReally.\nThis is the budget, or the next week of my life.\nYou know what they say... your life is just weeks and then you die.\nUh, Jess, are you sure you're okay?\nYeah.\nI just got this for a little stress relief.\n(laughs)\nOh, Schmidt, will you be a dear and text Cece and tell her I'm gonna be about, like, ten minutes late?\nYeah, sure.\nThanks.\nAah!\n(grunting, screaming)\nBecky! Becky!\nI hate you!\n(screaming)\n(knocking)\nHi!\nHello.\nLook who I brought. The French.\nBonjour. Oh, it's Prosecco, it's Italian.\nSo grazie.\nOh, it's Polish Prosecco.\nSo that's on me for buying it at a gas station.\nLong week of work ahead of me.\nI'm looking forward to a fun night!\nOkay, Jess, I should tell you before I...\nI know I said I was done packing, but I'm not done, and the reason I'm not done is because I didn't do anything, and I have to get out before tomorrow, otherwise I lose my deposit.\nOh, Cece.\nI know.\nCece, Cece, Cece.\nCece, Cece, Cece, Cece, Cece...\nHey, guys.\nHey, Winston.\nI did it. I told Aly I need a new partner.\nWhat? I thought you had a crush on her.\nYeah.\nWell, exactly. You know, here's the problem.\nShe keeps talking about her boyfriend and his \"ass that you want to open on Christmas.\"\nWhat?\nBut it's fine.\nYou know, she took it better than I thought.\nScrew you.\nHere's your crap: lucky crystal, key chain fart marker, over a hundred yogurt tops, your flattened penny collection, a signed copy of a Paul Reiser biography, baby carrot thumb drive, a picture of you and Dave Coulier, loose Pez, my mom's cell number, a ticket stub from Urinetown.\nWhen did you even see that?\nWhy? Why?\nOh, have you...\nHave you tried 'em on?\nOh, and your Pure Mood CD.\nThis thing makes me want to swim into a boat motor.\n(phone dings)\nOh... new partner's here.\nGuys, as they say, when one chapter ends, a bridge appears, and then you cross that bridge and make lemonade out of a molehill.\nOkay.\nHiya, partner. (laughs)\nThat's, uh, \"hi\" in karate. Hiya!\n(both laughing)\nThat's cool.\nYou don't mind if we listen to some car jams, do you?\nWell, man, let's just get right to track seven.\n Elations \n Elation \n Elations \nElation.\n Elation, elation \nElation.\n(both laugh)\nOh!\nI'm okay, it's fine, it's fine, yeah.\nYou okay, you good?\nIt's not gonna end well for these two.\nI wouldn't trust him to watch a ball pit.\nHey, could I get a cream soda?\nDude, we both know what you're gonna do.\nDon't. It's not cool.\nWhat? We have a flasher.\nYou know what, maybe if we get drunk, then magically everything will just happen.\nNo, no.\nNo drinking until you've packed.\nLook, I get that you're freaking out about moving, but we can do this. We need to make a keep pile and a toss pile, okay?\nKeep or toss, keep or toss.\n(phone dings)\nUgh.\nUh... Hi, Becky. Sorry, Principal Cavatappi.\nJess, remember that binder?\nYeah. Yup, I've got it right here.\nI'll have it done by the end of the week.\nYeah, I mixed up the budget due date.\nI took my contacts out 'cause they're ugly.\nSo I kind of can't read stuff.\nI'll need it tomorrow.\nUm... Uh, yeah, uh, but it's a week's worth of work.\nYou get it done or you're fired. (hangs up)\nI have to do a week's worth of work in a night.\nSo we got to get through this quick.\nKeep or toss, keep or toss.\nCece, that sweatshirt has a wine stain on it and an off-brand Looney Tunes character.\nGeorge Bunny? Who the hell is that?\nYou're right. Keep.\nToss!\nNo, keep, keep!\nI'm calling the cops. There is a man pulling out his privates in our bar.\nOh, big whoop.\nIt used to be worse. It used to be more interactive.\nWhat do mean, interactive?\nInteractive.\nYou showed, too?\nNo, it was more like tennis, like... (snaps fingers)\nExit.\nWhat's the second... (snaps fingers)\n(snapping fingers)\nNow it's just... (snaps fingers)\nAnd I'm...\nThis is a problem. Wi-Winston.\nNew partner is working out great, man.\nYou know, we have a lot in common.\nBoth have cats, both partially blind... me, color, him, night.\nWell, that sounds dangerous. Winston, listen to me.\nWe have some very serious police business here.\nThe bar has a flasher. A strange man is regularly showing Nick his funky soup bone.\nI'm sure he doesn't even care.\nI care about that greatly, Nick. I will be right there.\nWhoa, partner.\nOh, oh, oh, my goodness. Hey, didn't see...\nSeat's taken. the seat was taken there, Winston, I...\nYeah, I usually ride shotgun because I get motion sickness as a decision-maker.\nYeah, well, I lose all hand strength with absolutely no warning. Just...\nDamn it.\nMm... I'm sorry, I'll be fast. Mm...\nMm...\nMm...\nTime's up. It's a toss.\nNo, that was actually an award.\nToss. Next.\nJessica...\nNow, okay, look, that hat has a very important memory.\nHey.\nI-I'm sorry I'm so bad at doggy-style.\nDo you really want to remember Sir Miss-A-Lot?\nThis is all important stuff from my single life.\nI think I need to go through the pile again.\nYou know what, you're right. Let's go through everything again.\nCan you just come with me to the hallway and take a look at a pile I made out there?\nOh, yeah, okay.\nI just really appreciate it.\nMm-hmm.\nI know you got a lot of work to do.\nYeah, so it's...\n(gasps)\nI have to finish packing so I can work on the binder!\nYou made me do this! I'm shutting this tiny door!\nJessica, open the door!\nYou're a terrible packer!\nJessica, open the door!\nYour favorite team is the Green Bay... Not Packers.\nLet me in, okay? Because, you know, if I'm out here too long, I'm gonna run into...\nHey, neighbor, you dig turtles?\nIt's not a big deal.\nI've been flashed by, like, seven or eight different people since college.\nWhat?\nYou guys have been flashed?\nNo.\nNever.\nEverybody's been flashed countless times, right?\nNo.\nOh, it's just me who's been flashed about 300 times?\nWhat?\nYou guys have never been flashed?\nNo.\nNever.\nNot even on, like, holidays?\nBoth: No!\nNot even, like, after the Olympics?\nHey, guys, I still can't find the bathroom.\nWhere did you guys say it was again?\nThis place is like a maze.\nDunston, it's... it's one big room, buddy.\nNever mind. I don't have to go anymore.\nNo, no, no, no, you're fine, you're fine.\nYou've had, like, two tubs of soda. You-you need to go.\nYeah, I do have to go.\nIt's right back there to the left.\nOkay.\nYeah, right past the pop...\nSomeone call about a flasher?\nOh.\nJust responding to a call about a flasher.\nOh, yes. Uh, there is no need.\nDunston and I have got this, so...\nOh, how is Dunston?\nHuh? I hear he's blind and weird.\nNo. No, he's great.\nAh.\nDunston gets it done... ston.\nAnd that's how we win.. ston!\n(laughing) Oh.\n(laughing)\nHow are you?\nReally good.\nMm-hmm.\nYeah, Hutch is one hell of a cop.\nHutch: I'm very strong.\nPunch my stomach. Try.\nI mean, I will.\nIt won't hurt.\n(laughing): Okay.\nIt won't hurt.\n(laughing): God.\nMm-hmm.\nThat's amazing.\nDunston. Bathroom.\nYeah?\nOh, that's right.\nDunston?\nAh.\nDunston?\nNo, I know.\n(laughing)\nYou're in good hands.\nI hope you're happy, too.\nGreat!\nGreat!\nGreat.\nGreat!\nSomebody call the G8 Summit because I just felt the climate change.\nI don't get that.\nHmm. Excuse me.\nYou know where the bathroom is?\nIt's not back here.\nRight.\nIf you throw out one more thing, I am gonna hurl my body against the door!\nOkay, fine, I am gonna do it.\nI hope I don't hurt myself!\n(crying): Ow!\nYou think I don't know those were hands?\nThat was a slap sound!\nYeah.\nOkay, you're right, it's a slapping sound, but I-I think I overdid it and I really hurt my wrist.\nIt's, like, swelling.\nI'm telling the truth, okay? It really hurts.\nJust, can you please open the door?\nAnd now my wrists are fine!\n(screaming)\nYou snake! You rattlesnake!\n\n\n\nCece: Oh, my God, everything's gone.\nLook, Cece, I know you're freaking out about leaving the apartment, but if you think of it like...\nNo. It's just, it's not just the apartment.\nIt's just... it's... it's all of it.\nEverything is changing!\nI'm not gonna have this place anymore, and I'm getting married.\n(sighs)\nOh, my God, Jess, I'm getting married.\nAre you having second thoughts?\nNo, no. I... I know I want to marry Schmidt more than anything in the world.\nIt's just... everything is gonna change, and I am scared.\nOh, honey.\nOh, my little breakfast link.\nOkay, now, look, we don't have time for this.\nOkay, you have to work on your binder.\n(sighs)\nForget the binder.\nRight now this is more important.\nSo you know what we're gonna do?\nWhat?\nWe're gonna get into it!\nI'm gonna take my pants off!\nWhat? Why?\nSo, Nick, can you describe the suspect?\nMr. Miller, can you describe the suspect?\nUh, are you doing the interview, or...?\nOh, yeah, I'm usually the interview guy.\nOh, that's okay.\nNo, you can take it.\nI'll take it, dude, if it's not a big deal.\nHey, well, it can be either...\nNo, I'm used to it, too, but you're used to it, so it's not a big deal for me.\nWell, I mean, I'm used to it, but I'm open to new things.\nOkay, yeah, but to the count of three.\nJust-just-just please...\nWe're just gonna do it.\nBoth: One, two, three.\nYou do it.\nI can... I'm gonna go.\nHe was average size, thin, wispy blond hair.\nOddly shaped, kind of came to a point.\nUh, what does that mean?\nTop heavy.\nA bit of a scar as if like from a hook or something.\nGross. Ugh. Uh, anything else?\nI think that about does it. You want me to describe what his face and body looked like?\nYeah, that'd be... Wait.\nHave you been describing his penis this whole time?\nAll right, that's it. I'm done.\nI'm not even the one that called you guys.\nMan!\nAnd to be fair, I knew he was talking about a penis the whole time.\nSee?\nThat is way too real!\nAggressively detailed.\nI had to guess on the testicles, 'cause he hadn't described 'em.\nYou know what it is? It's just that there's no turning back.\nI mean, who am I when I leave this apartment?\n\"Mrs. Cece Schmidt?\"\n\"Cece Schmidt\" sounds like the mayor of an evil Swiss town.\n(laughter) It does.\nOh, my God.\nDid I tell you that Schmidt thinks that we should drop our last names and make up a new one?\nHe is currently, at the moment, leaning towards Zenith and Telluride.\nI don't hate Telluride.\nGetting married is just such a big leap.\nYou leap big all the time!\nYou moved here at 18 with nothing but a bunch of chokers.\nIsn't it amazing?!\nAnd it's mine.\nYeah, there's also a knife stuck in the wall.\nOh, look!\nSomeone left a spoon with some rock candy in it.\nI wonder what flavor it is.\nThis is a way bigger leap.\n(phone plays tune)\nUgh! Becky! You sloppy boob lizard!\nPrincipal Cavatappi!\nOh, yeah, the binder. Yup, I've got it right...\n...here.\n(whispers): Where's the binder?\n(gasps)\nUm, yeah, uh, sorry. Uh...\nUm, yeah, I've got it right here.\n(whispering): Find it. Find it.\nYou packed it somewhere?!\nYeah, I can turn to page 13. Hold on.\nOh. Chuka.\nChuka, chuka, chuka.\nChuka.\n(whispering): What is that?\nThat was a page-turning noise.\nChuka, chuka...\nUm, yup, I see the graph.\nChuk, chuka, chuk, chuk!\nJess?\n(sighs)\nDo you remember Rosarito?!\nWe don't have much to go on, but I'll run your description.\nHopefully, Dunston wouldn't have spilled coffee all over the radio.\nYou know, he brews his own and drinks it out of a sandwich bag.\nSchmidt: Winston, just call Aly and tell her that you want to be partners again.\nUgh. Look, guys, I...\nI cannot.\nI just cannot hear about Aly's boyfriend and his ass that don't quit, okay?\nMy ass don't quit! What about my ass?!\nWinston, please call Aly.\nSeriously, dude.\nThere he is.\nFlasher: Hey, do you have any, uh...?\nFreeze, buddy!\nOh, yeah, freeze!\nWait! Hey! (groans)\nOh.\nHey, hey, hey! Hey!\n(grunting, thudding)\nYeah! Got him! (laughing)\nAll right! Dunston!\nOh, yes.\nYeah, man. I'm not normally the cuff guy, but I'll do it.\nYeah, me, either.\nBut I'll do it.\nOne size fits all, right?\nYeah, I guess it's...\nMan, I just said, I'll be the cuff guy!\nI'm not normally the cuff...\nBut, yeah, but if I'm not normally the...\nThen if you're not... but I'm not normally.\nNow, I'm doing...\nOkay, okay, count of three. Count of three.\nWho is the cuff guy? One.\nAll right. One.\nBoth: Two, three, four.\nFive, six. See?\nFive. Mm.\n(overlapping chatter)\nAll right. Three.\nThree.\nBoth: Two, one, zero, negative one. Damn it!\nThat...!\nWinston, Dunston! Dunston!\nGo! Hey!\n(both grunt)\n(sighs)\nI got to say... he never comes in twice in a night.\nI just hope he's okay.\nI'm alarmed by how connected to this man you feel.\nI just hope the best for him.\nI am so dead.\nIf I don't find this binder, I'm gonna need a really good excuse. Oh, wait, Cece?\nMm.\nCan you break my arm just a little bit?\nNo!\nYou're right. It's better if I do it myself.\nOkay, you know what? Hey!\nHey, can I just throw something out there?\nWhat if you quit?\nI want to quit.\nGod, do I want to quit, but I can't! I can't!\nYou can quit. Because this Becky lady is making you miserable.\nYou were always someone who loved their job.\n It's my first day of teaching in L.A. \n And I'm giving my job \n A big fat \"A...\" \nYou remember the last time I was unemployed?\nI ran out of things to knit.\nI knit a condom.\nOh, the yarn-dom.\nI pray this was never used.\nOkay, remember earlier when you told me to leap?\nYou should leap.\nI don't leap.\nI take small planned steps, like an arthritic dog.\nReally?\nThe last listing is a loft downtown.\nBad area.\nThe ad just says it's \"sunsoaked and beige-y.\"\nI don't know. They seem like three nice girls.\nAnd now I am marrying one of those girls and totally freaking out about it.\nYou know who you need to talk to, right?\nYes. Definitely. Winston.\nNo.\nWhat the hell?\nWhat?\nI'm gone for two months, and all of a sudden Winston's a bridesmaid? Never mind.\nYou need to call Schmidt.\nNo.\nNo, I can't call him and tell him that I'm scared.\nI think that that's what getting married is.\nSharing all this, all the things you're afraid of, all the things that embarrass you, weak doggy-style guy.\nYou got to call Schmidt.\nAll right.\n(phone rings)\nA voice call, Jess?\nLet me guess, a family of ducks is crossing the street.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no. It's me. It's me. Um, so... okay, um, I love you but I am freaking out about getting married.\nCece, what? What's-what's going on? What's happening?\nWell, I just... I don't... I don't...\n(phone chimes)\nOh, no. Um, Jess, it's Becky. It's Becky.\nWhat-what-what do you want me to do?\nWhat do I do? What do I do?\nDon't answer it. Don't answer it.\nWhat? Who's Becky? What's a Becky? What's happening?\n(phone chiming)\nDon't answer it.\nDo not answer it.\nI'm gonna answer it.\nWhat?\nHello! Hi. Uh, yeah, so, this is Cece Parikh, and you are treating my friend very badly.\nWhat? Put Jess on.\nNo, no, no, no. You are done using my friend, okay?\nSo she... quits.\nI what?\nShe what?\nI what?\nThat's right!\nJess quits!\nNailed it!\nOh, my God, the binder. It's under the couch.\nNo, no, no. We handled it.\nIt's our perp.\nAly, I want you back. I...\nI-I want you back.\nAre you trying to tell me something or doing a Jackson 5 song?\nI miss having you as my partner.\n(scoffs) Do you want to tell me why you left?\n'Cause you never did. And, honestly, Winston, that really sucked.\nI left because you hurt my feelings when you kept talking about...\nYou kept talking about...\n...how much you hate my music. You know?\nThis is about your Pure Moods CD?\nThat's it. That's all. It's the only reason why I left.\nOkay. I mean, that thing makes me wish I was born without the ability to hear music, but if it means that much to you, I'll listen to it.\nI-I-I appreciate that.\nLook, you're the only partner I want.\nYou make me... laugh and whatever.\nI don't know. I suck at compliments.\nYeah.\nPartners?\nPartners.\nShake it. Don't just hold it.\nYeah. Sorry.\n(panting)\nI think that was Dunston.\nHow did he not see us?\nNo idea.\nOh, yeah, he's night-blind.\nDunston!\nIt's done. Everything you asked for.\nAnd, Principal Cavatappi, I'm very sorry for what my friend said. I...\nOh, I know. I would never let you quit anyway.\nCan you come up with some thoughts on the science curriculum for the superintendant and sign my name?\nYeah.\nSure. Yes.\nYou know what? No!\nI can't. (chuckles) No.\nNope. Um, because I quit.\nI hope you have a minor career setback, learn from it, relocate, and ultimately have a very nice life, Becky.\n(groans)\nMmm.\nDo I want to know this story?\n(chuckles) I hope so, because we're about to spend the rest of our lives together.\nSo you're gonna have to hear all my stories.\nI want to spend the rest of my life hearing all your stories.\nUntil, of course, my hearing goes out and I get tinnitus. Do you know Dave Letterman has tinnitus?\nUm...\nAbout-about what I said on the phone...\nI'm a little freaked out, too.\nYou are?\nYes.\nAnd it has nothing to do with how much I love you.\nExactly.\nOr how much I want to get married.\nExactly.\nWe'll be scared together.\nAnd we'll be really happy together, too.\nAnd we'll be really annoyed together, knowing that we're living with three other people and a cat.\nAlso, I think there's another cat.\nWinston's being very evasive about it, but...\nMmm.\nIt's a foster cat.\nI think it's helping him get over the whole Aly thing.\nI don't care.\nWell, I guess this is it.\nI thought Jess would be here, but... you know, okay, end of an era.\nYeah.\n(quietly): Have you ever been here before?\nThis is maybe my second time.\nI nursed my pippy back to health here.\n(chuckling): Yeah. I remember.\nAll right. I'm gonna give you a minute.\nOkay.\n(sighs)\nJess: Cece, Cece, Cece.\nDo you want to do the honors or should I?\nHmm... Go for it.\n(exhales)\nCece: Okay. One, two, three.\n(chuckles) We did it!\n(chuckles)\nJess: Oh, my God, there's hair on the end!\n(gasps) Put it back! Put it back!\n(door opens)\n(sniffles)\nJess: Do you speak Russian?\nCece: Nope.\n"}, {"title": "05x12 - D-Day.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nI need your advice on these wedding invites.\nI like calligraphy option number two; it looks like a Bone Thugs album.\nThis looks like an ad for a bong company.\nI like option one better.\nWinston: You know what would be nice?\nA wedding invitation engraved on a plate.\n(chuckling)\nWhat a magical wedding that would be.\nYou two are imbeciles.\nAnybody with taste and sophistication would always choose option number two.\nNick: Are you okay?\nYou look gray.\nI didn't sleep.\nI was up preparing for an epic day of wedding decisions.\nI'm calling it D-Day.\nOf course, in this situation, the \"D\" stands for \"decisions,\" and unlike the other D-Day, it will not be a walk on the beach.\nThat's incredibly offensive.\nI know.\n(door closes)\n(shrieks)\nDo you guys remember that audition I had for gas station TV?\nWell, the girl they hired went missing and they need me to fill in!\nYeah! - What?\nOh!\nJess: Oh, my God, we're gonna be friends with a gas celebrity!\nThat's right!\nBut it is today, and I know you need my help with the wedding stuff...\nCece, what are you talking about?

Saturday.\nUgh.\nCome on, listen, I got to do what I got to do, you know?\nUh, Gina, wait to induce until Sunday... afternoon.\nGina, don't you have something on Sunday?\nMy husband has his fantasy baseball league.\nHe won't attend the birth if it doesn't happen.\nThat's not the man you should be with, I'm sorry.\nAll right, where do you want these?\nWinston, where do we want these?\nWhere do we want...? Winston? No, dude.\nI don't know you like that, man.\nPut 'em where the beer goes.\nCome on, man, I got eight more deliveries.\nLook, I don't like the early shift.\n(disgruntled chattering)\nMercy?\nYes! Yes, yes, man. That's what I thought.\nCheese, the keg's gonna go where it always goes, right behind the bar.\nGuys, the schedule.\nOh, that's perfect. Thanks.\nThat works?\nBack to work, everybody. Good stuff.\nWinston: Listen, I get it.\nThis is confusing and everything, and I can't just walk in off the street and do your job instantaneously.\nBut come on.\nLet's be real.\nIt's still not harder than being a cop.\nThen prove it.\nOh, I'll prove it.\nLook, I know I told you to prove it, but I got to get back to the bar.\nI just got a text from Javier that said, \"fire extinguisher\" question mark.\nWell, all I got to say is, buckle up, Miller.\nIt's about to be a bumpy ride.\n(chuckles)\n(whispering): Uh, where... where are my sunglasses?\nHow the hell should I know?\nI specifically asked you to keep track of my sunglasses.\nAnd I told you I'm not your freaking mother.\nOkay, you know what, calm down, I'll just squint then.\nDo what you got to do, man.\nIs this how all partners talk to each other?\n(laughing): Welcome to hell, Miller.\nI'm no good at normal life, but when I'm in the ocean and drinking wine...\n...or spending time with a beautiful stranger...\n(giggles)\n...that's when I, uh, truly feel like myself.\nMmm.\nMm-hmm.\nHow do you feel about a little manchego?\nI feel very good about it.\nWe're not animals.\n(chuckles) Or maybe we are.\n(both laugh)\nHave you ever...?\nHmm?\n(both laugh)\nI have too much manchego.\nHappens to the best of us.\nHave you ever had your eyebrows combed by a woman you just met?\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n(door opens)\nAh.\nJess, thank you.\nYou know, I haven't had two hours of uninterrupted sleep since a month ago when Cece made me watch An Inconvenient Truth.\nEverything's under control. The bakery's sending over three cakes for you to try.\nOkay.\nAnd Gavin from the winery in Calabasas gave me a great deal.\nUh, you met Gavin in Calabasas?\nI didn't just meet him, we kissed a little.\n(shrieking)\nNo!\nUgh!\nSchmidt, what happened? What's wrong?\n(whispering): You just made out with my dad.\n(shrieking)\nSchmidt.\n(shushing)\nCan I just say one thing?\n(shushing)\n(door opens)\nHey, guys.\nSo, how did it go today?\nGood.\nWe got a lot accomplished.\nBut, um... how do I say this? Um...\nI made out with Schmidt's dad.\nYou did what?\nShe lulled me to sleep and then went rogue.\nYou did what?\nIf your files had been clearly marked, none of this would be happening.\nYou need better labels.\nSchmidt: Everything is perfectly clear.\nChairs are color-coded under chartreuse, because it sounds like \"chair truths.\"\nSalmon mongers are filed under fuchsia, because I \"re-fuchsia\" to serve salmon at this wedding.\nThe groomsmen tuxes are under magenta, because \"ma-gentlemen\" will be wearing the dope tuxes.\nIs he a good kisser?\nDon't ask that, plea... And don't you answer it.\n(stammers) It's withdrawn. I'm just freaking out right now.\nOkay, why don't we take this horrible, horrible, gross mistake into something positive?\nWhat if this is a sign that maybe you should reach out and talk to your dad again?\nWhy?\nWhy would I talk to my dad?\nHe left my mom and basically missed my entire childhood.\nAnd every time I did invite him to something, he never showed up: middle school graduation, high school graduation, when I played the titular role in a stage adaptation of Uncle Buck.\nWell, he's taken up surfing now.\nOh, he's taken up surfing? How nice.\nA middle-aged man who surfs and French-kisses his customers.\nWhat a hero.\nWhy did you have his number in the wedding drive at all?\nBecause I was maybe... warming up to the idea of inviting him, but now that the nightmare called \"this afternoon\" has happened, I can very well see that I'm not ready.\nSo I'm sorry, Jess, but there will be no papa nah-nah at the wedding for you.\nI'm sorry! He was feeding me cheese, and I...\nI d... Ugh.\nPlease stop.\nPlease. So many details.\nPlease.\nAnd-and God for... if you...\nJust... if the words \"he unbuttoned my\" comes out of your mouth, I'm gonna freak out!\nOh, thank God, Winston.\nYou're saving the city from a palm frond.\nLos Angeles can sleep soundly tonight, everybody.\nAll right, it was a slow-ass day.\nAly, will you tell him it's a slow-ass day?\nNo, I'm not getting involved in this.\nI'm not gonna be the yardstick in a penis measuring contest.\nDid you say \"yard\"? Wow, who are you dating?\nTape measure, fine.\nOkay, look, this has been great, uh, but I got to get back to the bar.\nDispatcher: 7-8-6-3.\nPossible 4-5-9 at 2-7-3 Elm Cross and Fairbanks.\nHell yes.\n4-2-4 responding. Over.\nBar boy, get in.\nAly, let's lock and load.\nIs your gun not loaded?\nYou have to load your gun, Winston.\n(knocking on door)\nOh, no.\nSchmidt, um, that's your dad.\nBoth: What?\nWhat-what is my dad doing at our front door?\nHe thinks we're going on a date.\nWhy would he think that, Jess?\nBecause I said, \"Let's go on a date.\"\nI'll get rid of him. Go to your room and close the door.\nDo not tell me what to do; you are not my mom.\n(gasps)\nOh, that's disgusting.\nJust go. Go.\nWait. Wait, wait.\nI don't trust you.\n\nHey, Gavin!\nNick: I know what this is.\nI'm not falling for it.\nYou don't have to stage a crime to make your job look hard.\nStay here. Make yourself as small a target as possible.\nI'll just be here napping out of boredom.\nWinston (on radio): I see signs of forced entry.\nWait, wait, wait, wait! I got movement!\nI'm shaking in my boots!\nOh, yeah, right, he's ru... No!\nAly: Halt! Police!\n(shouting)\n(screaming)\nAah!\nNo! Get away! Get out!\n(Taser buzzing, man screaming)\nOkay, I get it!\nYour job is way harder than mine!\nJust make the bad man go away!\nWhat?\nPut the gun down!\nYeah, my job is much harder!\n(screams)\nWe're gonna make him go away!\n(Nick shouting)\nCan't stand to see Nick like this, you know.\nAt least now, he understands being a cop is much harder than being a bartender.\nWe all got to learn that lesson sometime.\nIdiot, he doesn't think his job is harder.\nHe just wants you to see that he's grown and changed and whatever else stupid stuff people care about.\nOh.\n(quiet laugh)\nWhy are you looking at me like that?\nNo, no, I... (stammers)\nThat's why I need my damn sunglasses, man!\nYou shouldn't have them if you can't keep track of them, Winston.\nCome on, yeah.\nNo! No!\nHey, scoot over.\nNo, not in here! Not in here, no! No!\nYou have the right to remain silent.\nNo! No!\nGavin: What are you doing with a video camera on your head?\nHe is handsome.\nJess: That's a good question.\nOh, hey, look.\nThat's-that's good news for you, okay.\nIt's for work.\nI still hate him.\nThey want to make sure that we don't teach evolution.\nI'm an educator, so...\nOh, you told me.\nI believe you had me pressed up against a cask of Merlot at the time.\n(groans) He's a bottom?\nYou want to give me the tour?\nOr should we just crack this open and make out?\nWhat a line.\nWho is this clown?\nBottle opener in here?\nWell... oh.\nOh, actually, um, change of plans... I can't go on a date tonight, because I have to have dinner with one of my friends' fathers, coincidentally.\nNo pressure.\nIt's just that I had a lot of fun today.\nAnd, uh, I'd like to see you again.\n(shouts)\nWhat was that?\nOh.\nGunshots... the neighborhood's in a real slide.\nThis is my son's name.\n7 billion people.\nThere's got to be some overlap.\nWe'd better get you back to Calabasas, mister.\nWait a minute.\n'Cause...\nThis is my son!\nOh, my God, do you know my son?\nKind of.\nDoes he live here?\nUh...\nIs he here right now?\nI didn't know you were Schmidt's dad when we kissed.\nAnd you didn't know I was his roommate.\nAnd those are facts that will haunt us forever.\n(chuckles)\nBut I can't let you go in there.\nBecause... he's not ready to see you.\nAnd for once today, I...\nOkay.\nI want to respect his wishes.\nI get it.\nUm, wait, wait, wait, wait.\nNo, I'll go.\nWait, wait.\nWhat?\nHe's in there.\nShh.\nShe told him.\nSon?\nBabe, I think you should watch.\nI don't...\nSon.\nYou should watch.\nI know you're mad. I get it.\nDo you want me to take this off?\nI didn't do a good job being your father.\nYou're in a zone. I'm just gonna sit tight.\nAnd now you're getting married.\nI get it.\nI wouldn't have invited me, either.\nI've missed a lot.\nI'm sorry.\nIn my defense, I was stoned for most of the '90s.\nAnd the 2000s.\nFull disclosure... I was stoned this morning.\nI like weed.\nBut the point is, if you can forgive me even a little, I'd love to have a drink with you.\nAnd meet the man that you've become.\nCome on.\nGavin.\nThat's okay... Gavin, not Dad.\nThat's just where I'm at right now.\nUnderstood.\nI'm grateful you're calling me anything at all.\nI wanted to say I'm sorry.\nAnd I know that it might not seem genuine, because the only reason I came here today was to do stuff with your roommate.\n(groans) But in the past ten years, I must've picked up that phone to call you and apologize a hundred times.\nI really am sorry.\nGavin, this is my fianc\u00e9e Cece.\nShe is the reason that I am the man that I am today.\nIt's wonderful to meet you, Cece.\nI'm the terrible father.\nThank you.\nBecause whatever you did or didn't do, Schmidt turned out amazing.\nAll right.\nI'm gonna head out.\nI'm sure it will be a beautiful wedding.\nI wasn't very good at being married.\nBut thankfully you seem like you're nothing like me.\nFor what it's worth, I like the second option.\nTimeless.\nI agree.\nGood-bye.\nOkay, wa... uh... (clears his throat)\nWait, uh...\nHere, that's for you.\nLet's see if you can show up this time.\nI hope that you do.\nThank you.\nThere's no plus one, so don't even ask.\nI'll be there.\n(sighs)\nBack to square one on the seating chart.\nOh!\nSorry, I'm a little bit jumpy.\nGod, they should really make a TV show based off what you guys do.\nYou know, I've been telling that to Aly since forever!\nIt'd be a great idea.\nHello, Hollywood!\nIt's a big show!\nYeah, it's a hit.\nI want to apologize.\nI'm sorry that I thought my job was harder than yours.\nIt's not. I'm just making schedules and buying beer.\nLook, man. (chuckles)\nThe whole thing has been pretty idiotic.\nYou know, uh, my job is harder than yours.\nYes, that's a fact. We all know it.\nBut I got to say, man, this is first time I've seen you really care about your job.\n(chuckles)\nYou're killing it.\nIt means a lot to me that you said that.\nSo thank you.\nYeah, yeah.\nSo, look, I got... I got us burgers.\nOh!\nYou know, I figured we're both too busy for steak.\n(both laugh)\nThe tradition!\nNick, I need a drink.\nIt'd better be green, sweet and in a fun glass.\nSchmidt, are you okay?\nI mean, you look a little freaked...\nOh... oh-oh, Cece!\nCece's pregnant!\nNo.\nOw.\nJess made out with Schmidt's dad.\nOh, my God!\nSo many emotions.\n Got an old hound dog \n Bobby Joe is his name \n Got an old hound dog... \nWell, I mean, did you like it?\nDon't answer that.\nEw, it was Schmidt's dad.\nYou're not answering the question.\nNo, she's not answering the question.\nSweetie, you don't have to say anything.\nI liked it a little bit.\n(guys groaning, clamoring)\nDude.\n"}, {"title": "05x13 - Sam, Again.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nBoo!\nSorry to startle you.\nYou didn't startle us.\nYeah, you struggled with the lock for like thirty seconds.\nI got a new job!\nBabe, that's great.\nOh, that's awesome.\nWell, not really \"new.\"\nI'm starting on a trial basis tomorrow.\nSo where is it?\nIs it at that super crunchy school?\nIt's the most progressive school in Los Angeles.\nIt's basically heaven if heaven were populated with kids that look like tiny members of Arcade Fire.\nSounds like your dream job.\nI'd give you a hug, but my shirt smells pretty weird today.\nThank you. I was actually worried.\nIt was getting rough out there.\n(speaking French)\nAh...\nLa-la-la-la-la-la.\nGod, I miss Paris.\nStop it!\nWha...? I was drinking that.\nIt's Jess's.\nEvery time she gets a job at a new school, she brings back kid germs that infect your filthy body.\nDon't get me sick.\nDon't get me sick either, man.\nI got a date coming up, and I might get to mouth-base.\nI'm not gonna get sick.\nNo germ can live in a body that is 65% beer.\nNick, are you eating raisins from my purse?\nI confiscated those from a kid.\nThat explains why they're so sticky.\n(chuckles) Sticky Nicky eats anything and I don't get sick.\nNick, you have, like, 7,500 raisins all over your room.\nWhy would you eat the...? (sneezes)\nI knew it. I knew it.\nThat was so immediate.\nAnd this is our nondenominational Eden.\n(Jess gasps)\nWow.\nI know.\nJess: Did the kids build the chicken coup?\nYep. Only hens, though, obviously.\nBanyon Canyon has a strict \"zero cocks\" policy.\nI like how it... it encourages the chickens to stay inside but doesn't force them.\nIn line with our philosophy.\nWho are we to tell the children what to learn and when?\nTheir teachers?\nWilliamsburg ate my seaweed, Genevieve.\nNo, I didn't.\nDon, Williamsburg, do I have your permission to move this conflict to the Feelings Farm?\nW-Wait, Jess, we sit on the floor.\nChairs are reserved for the children's feelings.\nOh.\nThis is much better than solving problems the Coolidge way.\nThere's a fight in the gym!\nOh, my God!\nI got this, Jess.\nChildren (chanting): Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!\n(chanting stops)\nI've been thinking about starting to wear a watch again.\nLet me open the barn door and welcome Honesty.\nBoth: Hi, Honesty.\nWilliamsburg, now, Honesty is here and has no agenda but to listen.\nHonesty, I ate the seaweed.\nAnd I'm sorry.\nAnd, Don, do you have anything to say to Honesty?\nHonesty, sorry for being so macho.\nI'm sorry I picked you last for touch basket.\nI'm sorry I insulted you for having a mommy and daddy.\nBeautiful, Jess.\nWell done.\nThank you.\nInto quarantine, you.\nHuge presentation at Ass-Strat tomorrow, and I cannot be sick for it.\nWomen I work with hate weakness.\nYou show up sick, you-you might as well be dead.\n(sneezes)\nUh, I'm... I'm so sorry.\nNo, uh, it wasn't really...\nGet out.\nGuys, I'm on the mend.\nSorry, Nick.\n(sneezes)\nWinston here has got that hot coffee date tomorrow, so...\nBut, to be clear, the date's hot, not the coffee.\nUh, thinking about going iced.\nDon't look at my hands.\nThanks for backing me up, boo.\nOh, you know how boo do.\nYou know who's my boo? I got a clue it's you.\nAw...\n(sneezes)\nSo... this is the most time we've ever spent alone.\nPretty interesting observation on your part.\nYeah.\nWhat are we... what are we watching?\nWe are having a...\nI just started streaming it, and now it won't stop playing.\nBoy, ham sandwiches.\n(laughs)\nWhat is it?\nIt's hard to say.\nIt's either a puppet show for kids, or it's North Korean propaganda.\n(screaming)\nPretty weird.\n(screaming)\n(Nick snickers)\n(both chuckle)\nGenevieve: I feel like we have a real connection.\nMe, too.\nI know it's only the first day of your trial period, but my gut is telling me... you're a perfect fit.\nI just... like, I'm so happy here, I could cry, but the gray water bucket's too far away, and I want to save my tears to water these plants.\nThat's considerate. Ooh!\nMy partner's here to pick me up.\nI think you're gonna really like him.\nSam: Sorry I'm late.\nThe string came out of my prayer beads, and they just bounced all over the office.\nOh...\nSo frustrating.\nGenevieve: Sam, I want you to meet Jess.\nThis is the candidate we were discussing in the shower.\nYeah.\nJess, this is Sam, my partner.\nHey, Jess.\nYou're a doctor for children.\nUh, it's, you know, mostly paperwork.\nHow do you always look so beautiful in the morning?\n(grunts)\n(Nick groans)\nOh, my God.\nYou could have killed him.\n(strained): I'm gonna kick your ass, man.\nHi, Sam.\nHi.\nHave you met before?\nWe... Yeah, we've met.\nWe did. Yes, that's right, we met, we met.\n(laughing): How funny.\nUm, a bunch of times.\nA lot of times. Very many. A lot of times.\nWe met a lot... Yeah.\nSometimes in the day, sometimes... in the, uh, nighttime.\nOh.\nIt was, you know...\nYeah, we, I mean...\nYeah.\nOh.\nBye, Jess.\nNice to see you.\nThe fly shirts and the even more fly shirts.\nOkay, let's make this quick.\nI need to work on my presentation.\nIt's for a chair company, and it's tentatively titled, \"I Hope You're Sitting Down for This.\"\n'Cause it's chairs.\nYeah.\nAt which point you would laugh if you weren't so preoccupied with your date.\nOkay, Winston, what are you wearing?\nWell, you know, I don't want to overthink it.\nIt's just coffee, so...\nSo you're going to just dress like you did today, which apparently happened during a solar eclipse in a land of no mirrors.\nGood note. Strong note.\nWinston, listen to me.\nYeah.\nThis is the first date since the... since the Aly heartbreak.\nThis date is going to define the next chapter of your dating story.\nWear these magnificent sunglasses.\nPut 'em on.\nOh, man.\nYou look like Brad Pitt on a tank.\nIn that movie Furry.\nYeah.\nYou ever see Furry?\nFurry? Nah.\nIt's a bunch of dudes on a tank. They're, uh... and they're outnumbered and they shoot a bunch of people.\nAre they dressed in...?\nYou should check it out. Just look it up, Furry.\n(chuckles) Google \"Furry,\" nice, yeah.\nHey, don't screw up this date, it's important.\n\n(imitates sneeze)\n(sniffles)\n(coughing)\nHow is Genevieve dating Sam?\nIs Los Angeles that small?\nYou guys even listening to me?\nYeah, we're listening.\n(gibbers)\nWhat-what did Queen Ta Ta say?\nWell, the ball's tonight, and Queen Ta Ta's got nothing to wear, so she's got to find a dress.\nWhat the hell is this show?\nBoth: Poppycock Palace.\nIt's amazing.\nWinston, when did you get sick?\nYou were fine this morning.\nOh, yeah, I'm super sick.\n(imitates sneeze)\n(sighs) Genevieve just said, \"Oh.\"\nOh's, like, the worst.\nWhat should I do?\nDon't do anything.\nJust do nothing.\nNick: You're just gonna make it worse.\nLeave it alone, Jess.\nOh, I know.\nI could go talk to Sam.\n(nose blowing)\nI could ask him to put in a good word for me.\nHow long does it take to get over a breakup?\nTwo years? Two years is enough, right?\nI swear to God, just leave it alone.\nSchmidt: Let it lie.\nDo nothing, Jess.\nFour votes for leaving it alone.\nThat's what I'll do.\n(all shouting)\nI'll just do nothing.\nHi.\n(chuckles)\nI couldn't do nothing.\n(groans)\n(coughing)\n(coughs)\nWe must find this Tee-Tee Wah Wah...\n(sniffs loudly)\nHumina humina humina humina...\n(Nick groans)\n(clears throat, Cece coughs)\n(sniffling)\nAll these puppets do is sing about how they're friends.\nI'm starting to not believe them.\n(fanfare plays)\nShh!\nThis is the best part.\nThe Tee-Tee Wah Wah was in...\n(drumroll plays)\nIt's in the damn Pee-Paw Playhouse!\nShh.\nSpoiler alert, man.\nThe Pee-Paw Playhouse!\n(laughing)\nEvery time.\nI've been saying that for the past hour 'cause I saw you put it in there!\nYou know what?\nI can't. I can not.\nI'm not sick.\nI've been faking it.\nThere you go, Poppycock Palace.\nYou've outed me!\nYou're choosing to be in here?\nWhy?\n'Cause I'm freaking out about the date. Okay?\nWhy don't you want to go on this date?\nBecause I'm not over Aly.\nAnd I know I should be moving on and this girl is okay, but she's not Aly.\n(congested): No one is Aly.\nWhat'd she say?\nWait.\nJust hold.\nOh, please don't blow your nose.\nYou do it so disgustingly.\n(blowing loudly)\nNot done.\nI don't need to know that bad what you said.\n(Cece blowing nose loudly)\n(continues blowing)\nI'm beggin' you to stop. Just stop.\n(sniffs wetly)\n(coughs)\n(clearly): No one is Aly.\nOkay? You have to give other people a chance.\nYou deserve to be happy, Winston.\nJust go on the date.\nOr I could fire up another episode and we could see where they hide the Tee-Tee Wah Wah this time.\nI wonder where it would be.\n(breathing roughly)\nNo, I'm-I'm gonna go on the date.\nYeah, I think I'll do that.\nYou guys are right.\nCould you tell your future husband to let me out of this room, please?\nI love that man, but he is not letting anyone out of this room.\nJust being in here makes you fully contaminated.\n(puppets chattering happily)\nUh, hey, I was hoping you could put in a good word for me.\nI know you're mad...\nNo, I'm not mad, Jess.\nI'm just, you know, bummed that you're at my house.\nObviously, I know I messed up our relationship and you probably think I'm a bad person, but if you could...\nJess!\nWhat are you doing here?\nAt my lover's house?\nOh!\n\n\n\nHi! Hi.\nUm, were you...\nMaking love?\nJust finished.\nHe defused me like a bomb.\nThat sounds nice.\nUm...\nDid you bake...\nSam brownies?\nNo. Chocolate's way too sexual.\n(laughs)\nThis is just good, old-fashioned Kansas cornbread.\nJess...\nNo. (chuckles)\n...my gut is telling me this isn't going to work out.\nPlease give me a chance to make this right.\nFive minutes.\nMmm...\n(high-pitched): Mmm...\nOkay, good morning.\nYes, help yourself to a bagel.\nHmm.\nThey're all the same, Jan.\nNo need to put your hands on every one of them.\nOkay, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on the seventh day, God... he rested.\nYes, that's right.\nGod rested on the seventh day.\nBut the question remains: what did he rest on?\nThat's right.\nHe rested... on a chair.\n(sneezes)\nOh...\nLook underneath your butts.\nYou will find mankind's greatest invention.\n(exhales)\nWithout chairs, do you know what we have?\nSquat, both position and diddly kind.\nJess: Sam, you got rid of your sofa.\nBoy, that thing really gave me a rash.\nFive minutes, Jess.\nOkay, look.\nI know it's weird to hire your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend, but I think it's another way in which we are linked.\nYou are the best candidate we've had in a long time.\nThank you.\nAs we all know, healing is talking.\nSamuel, what do you think?\nI would love to explore all of this with you, but I have a circumcision to perform.\nHopefully not your own.\nJust kidding. I know you're circumcised.\nHa, ha. Yeah.\nWell, not that I think about it, it just...\nI mean, I'm definitely not picturing it right now.\nI am picturing it.\nOnly 'cause we talked about it.\nHow long did you two share your journeys?\nCouple months.\nBut at first it was just sex.\nMmm. Mmm.\nSam: I used sex as a wall around my heart.\nMmm.\nUh, Jess climbed that wall many, many times.\nMmm.\nUh, couldn't stop climbing it.\nI think I was not the only climber to climb that wall.\nUntil we decided to become a one-wall, one-climber mountain.\nAnd then you invited another climber to lick your toehold.\nMy roommate, Nick, kissed me.\nI'm so sorry, Sam.\nI exist only in the present.\nAll of that's behind me.\nWhat... what about this Nick?\nIs he sorry?\nI think Nick's kind of still upset that Sam punched him in the throat.\nWhat?\nSam... so tender and delicate...\nYou haven't met Nick.\nHe's just the most throat-punchable boy in all the world.\nI don't care. I don't even...\nNick is a whatever, I don't even have to...\nSam, do you need this Nick to apologize for wounding you?\nI do.\nJess: So, Nick...\nI'm wondering if you could come in the other room with me and just, like, real quick, apologize to Sam for kissing me?\nNo.\nJess, I told you to leave it alone.\nI didn't, though.\nI made it worse.\nNow the only way I'm gonna get that job is if Nick apologizes to Sam.\nJess, he hit me. He's gonna hit me again.\nHe's not gonna hit you.\nPlease, it's my dream job.\n(puppets chattering)\nI'd like to apologize, Nick, for punching you in the throat.\nI know it hurt a whole lot.\nNot that much, but you did it, so...\nOkay.\nAnd I feel like you should apologize to me for kissing my girlfriend.\nYes, uh, right.\nCool.\n(exhales) Well, that went so well.\nI-I don't really feel like that was a genuine apology, and-and I'd really like one.\nYeah.\nI mean... did you feel like it was genuine?\nActually, he didn't even apologize.\nCool beard, Sam.\nWhat'd you just say about my beard, bro?\n\"Bro\"?\nYeah, I just said \"cool beard.\"\nI think your beard looks really cool.\nTalk about my beard one more time, bro.\nSam, \"bro\" is a beach term.\nThe beard is very fun.\nSay \"beard.\"\nYou want me to say the word that starts with a \"B,\" ends with a \"D\"?\nYeah.\nSay \"beard\" one more time, bro.\nSay the word \"beard,\" bro!\n(quietly): Beard.\n(grunts)\nOh! Oh!\nNick, are you dying?\n'Cause it looks like you're dying!\nNot dying.\nWho are you?\nI don't know what it is.\nI just can't help it with this guy.\nWhy didn't you just hit me in the nads like a normal person, Sam?\nWell, I'm leaving.\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't, don't go!\nNobody goes.\nJim Morrison.\nThat's who you look like.\nWe are solving this conflict in the mother-loving Feelings Farm.\nThose sunglasses are amazing.\nWell, they're made even more amazing by your reflection in them.\nWait, how are you seeing my reflection in them?\nYou got me. I'm not.\n(both laugh)\nI'm just running game.\nAre you this smooth-talking in regular glasses?\nNo, I'm not that smooth-talking, no.\nI'm not.

Well.\nNo, we'll never have that.\nOf course I'm proud that this bar breaks even, but I think that you can do better than that.\nI didn't just invest in this bar, Nick.\nI invested in you.\nNo, you didn't.\nYou don't have equity in me, and we're...\nI get it.\nHey, Connie... yours isn't the only bar on the block that has valet, starting immediately.\n(sniffling quietly)\nWe have valet, kiddo.\nYou got valet.\n(voice breaking): You got valet.\nThis is beautiful.\nThe valet's yours. The valet's yours.\nUm... are they in love?\nYes. Very much so.\nOkay.

My buddy Andy makes it in his basement.\nI'm not allowed to say anything else about it, though.\nWow, I'm not kidding.\nI think this is the best whiskey that I've ever had.\nYou want to go out with me sometime?\nWhat? No. No.\nNo, no, no. Never.\nNever.\nNick: But the whole back and forth with, like, the fish and getting mad at each other...\nNever. Never.\nWhen you came back and threw the fish down...?\nNothing...?\nWhere did you get there, from I like this whiskey to...?\nWhat the hell was that?\nYou know what? Let it go.

There's no more restraining order.\nAnd no more cop face.\nGirl, this is my friend face.\nHonestly, I can't tell the difference.\nWell, there is no difference.\nThat's why I have to announce it.\nAnd as your friend, Winston, I just want to make sure that you two have thought things through.\nThat you're not rushing into things, you know?\nYou don't hurt each other again.\nI'm thinking, maybe, as your friend, maybe... you should be restraining yourselves.\nBecause of the restraining order?\nLook, we've grown up a lot.\nWe've made mistakes and we've learned from them.\nJess, nobody takes out a restraining order unless they think that they're in danger.\nWinston's right.\nWhat?\nYou're dangerous.\nI mean, you're dangerous to me.\nYou want to know why I got the restraining order?\n(inhales deeply)\n'Cause I couldn't stop thinking about you either.\nI didn't trust myself not to call you and start this whole thing up again.\nYou know, you-you've changed, Jess, and that's great, I just... I haven't.\nAnd I'm still mad at you and... that's gonna take some time.\nI think the, uh, best, smartest thing for us to do is to just...

Take away your things and go...\nTake away your things and go.\nYeah.\nYes.\nGood-bye, Jess.\nGood-bye, Sam.\nThat's enough.\nWinston: Wow.\nPowerful stuff.

Are we looking at the owner of a new used car?\nNo. (scoffs) I wish.\nBilly from Car County started playing misogynist bingo with me as soon as I walked in the door.\nHe called me \"dollface.\"\nStarted pointing out all the room in the trunk for my shopping bags.\nThen, he explained four-wheel drive to me.\nI don't need four-wheel drive explained.\nIt's very well named.\nLike World Series of Poker champion, Chris Moneymaker.\nContinue, though.\nOkay, you know how you get back at this guy?\nHuh. You do the entire thing online.\nYou set up an e-mail address, but under a dude's name.\nYes. I love it.\nHelp! Help!\nThere's some lunatic after me! (yelling)\nOh, my God!\nCall 911!\nCall 911!\nPlease, somebody help me.\n(everyone yelling at once)\nWinston! Winston, go...!\nJess: Oh, my God! Stay there! Wait!\nDon't pull it out.\n(laughing)\nHa, ha, ha, ha.\n(both laughing)\nYou just got Rhonda'd.\n(laughing)\nRhonda'd!\n(Rhonda and Winston laughing)\nWhat's your last name?\nI'm almost done with my \"Jeff Day\" e-mail to the dealer.\nI've constructed a very rich back story for him.\nListen to this, listen to this.\nOkay.\nHe wrote this while on break from his job, which is hanging telephone line.\nHe should have a desk job by now, but the ground has always been trouble for him.\nYeah, the poles are safer.\nAnd sometimes, at dusk, he can see his buddies from Desert Storm dancing in the static.\nThat's beautiful.\nYeah, it's okay.\nSo you need a dude pass before you send it off, right?\nNo, I don't need a dude pass.\nNo, no. Listen to this.\nMy wife is on my nuts.\nI need two grand off the MSRP.\nGo, Clips.\nGo, Clips! Good, yeah.\nHey, Nick, if anyone's gonna give Jess a dude pass, it's gonna be me.\nA dude pass.\nNot a pretty-boy pass.\nNot a \"I make my money from my mind\" pass.\nNot a \"I look like the cute benchwarmer on an NBA team, \"but I'm not good enough to play.\"\nAre you done?\nAfter I take my dude pass, why don't you take a short guy pass?\nWhy don't you take a snake voice pass?\nIs it frustrating for you when you go to concerts and you can't see the stage 'cause you're so short?\nIt can be.\nIt can be!\nI know we're in an awkward situation.\nI used to date Nick, now I'm dating Sam, again.\nI thought we were over all this.\nAnd now every time I turn around, you guys are in some kind of turf war.\nAre we in a turf war? I didn't even notice, you punk.\nThis can't go on forever.\nLet's just get our emotions out there.\nLet's just express ourselves...\nI'm good. I don't...\nI got nothing.\nYeah, I mean, everything's fine.\nYou feel good?\nYeah, I feel great.\nYou feel good, I feel good.\nYeah, I got nothing to talk about, yeah.\nWe're good, man.\nI don't feel nothin' towards you man.\nYou can spit on the bottom of my shoe, dude.\n(Winston laughing)\nLet's...\nSchmidt: This is what you want for our nuptials?\nShenanigans?\nThis is our wedding, Cece, not \"Ernest Goes to Our Wedding.\"\nCan't we just revoke Winston's plus one?\nOkay, look, I'm sure there's more to Rhonda than just pranks, all right?\nWe owe it to Winston to get to know her.\nWell, let's start at the beginning.\nTell us about your childhood. Where'd you grow up?\nWell, I grew up in Baltimore.\nOh.\nI don't like to talk about it around new people, but we were homeless.\nOh, I'm... I'm so sorry.\nI had no idea.\nIt was tough.\nWe didn't have money for food, clothes, toys.\nMy brother and I adopted a rat.\nI remember, we called the rat Singular Wireless.\nHe was sweet.\nUntil he ate my brother's pinkie toe clean off.\n(quietly): What?\nHe bit it like a baby carrot.\nJust (snapping).\nIt woke me up.\nThat snap, that snap.\nIn the end, we laughed about it, 'cause what else can you do?\nJust Singular being Singular.\nGosh darn it.\n(sighing)\nHe ran away after a while... my brother, not the rat... he didn't get far, obviously, not with nine toes.\nListen, it wasn't a great childhood, and I know that I come on strong, but I guess, if I can scare people with my pranks, then I know I'm not the only one who's scared.\nWhat a cruel, terrible world we live in.\nI had no idea.\nI'm so, so, so, sorry.\n(both guffawing)\nYou're stupid, Schmidt.\nAnd you're-you're stupid, too, Cece, Stupid.\nOkay, wait, so the en... the en... the entire story is a lie?\nRhon. Da'd.\nPow-pow.\nNeed a little more of this.\nAnybody else want some, uh, wine?\nOh, no, thanks.\nI salted it.\n(Rhonda guffaws)\nYou salted the wine? How is that even a prank?\nYou just told her that you salted it before she took a sip.\nUnless of course that the prank is that there's no salt in it.\n(spits)\n(guffawing)\nYes, there's salt.\nThere's most definitely salt in that.\n(laughing)\nThis is delightful.\nMr. Day, I, too, love Sons of Anarchy.\nYou drive a pretty hard bargain.\nI agree to your terms!\nYou just have to sign the papers in person.\nI'm at the dealership for another hour.\nAh, I did not think this through.\n(sighing, groaning)\nNick... I have hit a snag in my car buying.\nI'm not surprised you came to me.\nI heard you and, uh, Dr. Trap-Jaw last night, and he climaxes like a woman.\nThat was me.\nThen you sound like a woman when you climax.\nI am a woman.\nWhat's your point?\nWe're still on your point.\nI'm waiting for you to wrap it up.\nMy point is... your car deal went south, and so you need Nick Miller to twist some nips for you, yeah?\nNope. The nips have already been twisted.\nAll I need right now is someone to pretend to be Jeff Day.\nAnd I would ask Sam, but he's in a procedure all day.\nHe's de-webbing some kid's toes.\nIt sounds whimsical, but it's actually very serious.\nWhy would you go to him?\nHe cannot close this deal for you, Jess.\nThe deal has already been closed.\nRight now, I just need, literally, any man.\n(chuckling)\nIf I could wish a mannequin to life, I would.\n(both laughing)\nOh, Jessica.\nYou understand that fate fused that kid's toes together.\nAnd Dr. Sam is the man for that job, but I'm the man for this job.\nSo if you excuse me, let me get my Julius Pepperwood disguise.\nWait, no, no, no. You don't understand.\nI just need you to pretend to be Jeff Day.\nWell, I need some sort of disguise.\nAbsolutely not.\nWhat about a mustache?\nThat's a disguise.\nNot if I grow one.\nWe're in the car in ten minutes.\nYou gonna grow a mustache in ten minutes?\nNo man could do that.\nScientifically impossible.\nHey, I guess science always wins, right?\nSee ya in the car.\nJess: All right, now remember, Jeff Day is a lovable schnook, who makes sausage in his spare time.\nYou work for the phone company, so you call the phones \"units.\"\nAll right, what's my back story?\nUnits, that's good. Uh, you're my wife.\nYou spend all day making sausages, and clucking with the other hens on the kitchen unit.\nNo, no. I'm a disgraced ice-skating sensation.\nI got ex-communicated from the sport for protesting that nudie fabric.\nAnd then I broke my butt.\nRight, and which toe is webbed?\nUgh, Nick, that's real life.\nUgh. This is gonna be a disaster.\nAbort, abort.\nDollface!\nYou're back!\nHi. I am, I am.\nUm, I believe you've been e-mailing with my husband Jeff.\nJeff Day.\nLover of meats, enemy of nonsense.\nPut her there. (laughs)\nNice mustache.\nMy guy.\nAll right.\nOh, excuse me for a minute.\nI have to go feed the meter.\nUh, excu... before you go, can you please fill us in on all active pranks at this table?\nI think you found them all, okay?\nRelax.\nOh, wait! Winston...\nI put a watch battery in your huevos rancheros.\n(Rhonda laughs)\nIn the huevos?\nNo, you did not.\nWinston, she's been sitting down this whole time.\nDoes she have someone working with her in the kitchen?\nCan you explain to me how that's funny?\n'Cause you could have cracked a molar or choked to death.\n(laughing) It's hilarious.\n'Cause what if I choke on the battery?\nYou know what I mean?\nOr if the battery breaks open inside of me, you know? and causes all kinds of... no?\nWhat-what? You guys don't like her?\nMm...\nUh...\nAnd I mean, look, I get it.\nShe might not be the one, but come on, at least we're having fun, right?\nWe gave her a chance, okay, Winston?\nBut I am scared to touch my food, and I don't want to feel that way at our wedding.\nYes.\nWinston, it brings me no joy to do this, whatsoever, but I'm revoking your plus one.\nYou gave me that plus one, which means I can bring anyone.\nPlus one means plus anyone.\nFor the Schmidt-Parikh wedding, it's a plus the one.\nYou just had that one locked and loaded, didn't you?\nExcuse me, sir? Here's your check.\nOh, my God!\nThat's my face. Why is that my face?\nHa-ha!\n(laughing)\nWinston: No, no, no, no.\nSave it.\nIt's gonna be wasted on these two.\nLet's get out of here.\nHow did she get a mask of my face?\nOh... (scoffs) did they just stick us with the bill?\nN... no.\nShe left, like, $300.\nWho does this prank?\nThanks for meeting with us.\nI don't know... what made me think I could have possibly bought a car by myself.\nYou were right to get your hubby involved.\nNow, Mr. Day, your mind seemed pretty made up over e-mail.\nLook, Billy, I wish, uh, we could get twin hogs, but then the missus would stop giving me that sweet potato pie.\nYou know Jeff Day, I need my sweet potato pie every four hours.\nAin't that right, baby?\nI married a hungry man.\nBilly: If you're open to other options, we just got a consignment of vehicles that we are looking to move at rock bottom prices.\nI had my heart set on that cute little car that you showed me in that e-mail you wrote.\n(chuckles)\nHad a really big makeup mirror, and I sure was excited about it.\nBa-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, buh-buh...\nThere's no harm in hearing what the catch of the day is, right?\nNo harm.\nExactly.\n\n\n\nBilly, Jeff needs to take his omega-3 pill.\nCould you grab us a glass of water?\nNot a problem.\nI got a bad ticker myself.\nNot... uh... I had him right where I wanted him.\nHe's trying to bait and switch us, and you're gobbling it up like an old king with a turkey leg.\nYou're leaving money on the table.\nI can smell it.\nWatch. I'm gonna string him along, and then I'm going to get you a better deal.\nHe thinks he's fishing for me.\nNah, I'm fishing for him, but from the water.\nYou're in way over your head.\nRight where a fish wants to be.\nHere's your water, and... take as many mouse pads as you want.\nQuit stalling me.\nSmart.\nTell me about the secret stash, Billy.\nThese vehicles are a lot bigger than what you were e-mailing about.\nWell, a car can never be too big, and a pot can never be too sweet.\n(mouthing)\nI hear ya, so I guess, don't waste your time with anything smaller than a two liter?\nTwo liter?\nI want a car, not a Mountain Dew.\n(all laughing)\nYou want to send this girl out on to the road with a little bulk, in case she gets hit, or more likely, hits someone, am I right? (laughs)\nWhile she's text messaging.\nThey can't stop.\nThey're beautiful, but... (boinging)\n(laughing): I like you.\nHoney, don't forget how much research you put in.\nYou don't want to throw that all away, like I did with my skating career.\nJeff, you clearly know your way around an engine.\nWhat are we talkin', 5.0?\nYou want the bird to sing in my underpants, I'm gonna need double digits.\nOh, yeah, Jeff. baby!\nOh, yeah.\nYeah!\nIt's gonna sing.\nBoom.\n(cell phone chiming)\nYou get me.\n(Billy and Nick laughing, making goofy noises)\nExcuse me. I have to take this.\nIt's Oksana Baiul. Honey, get the car I want, or the only pie you'll be eating is out of the garbage.\n(laughs)\nHey, I thought you were de-webbing.\nWell, it took less time than I thought.\nYeah, he only wanted his big toe free, so he could wear flip-flops.\nHow's the new car?\nUgh!\nDon't make a thing out of it, but I had to ask Nick to be Jeff Day.\nYou asked Nick for help, not me?\nWell, you were in surgery, and he was the only person I could find, but he's screwing it up so much that I really wish I'd \"Reverse-Tootsie'd.\"\nOf course he's screwing up. He's a little human porkchop.\nI'm on my way.\nWait, don't come. Don't come.\nI could be Jeff Day.\nI just need to find a fake mustache.\nWhat is it with you guys and mustaches?\nLook, I have the situation un-under control.\nCutting Winston's plus one creates a real ripple effect.\nJason gets bumped from 14.\nRuthie gets bumped from 6, landing Tyler right next to the bar, which feels like tempting fate.\nYeah, you know what? The more I think about it, we may have judged Rhonda a little too harshly.\nMaybe you're right. You know what?\nIf Winston is happy, with Lady Kutcher, we should support him.\nWhat's the worst that can happen?\nMaybe she'll put some cellophane over the toilet bowls.\nHopefully, my Uncle Randy doesn't get (door opens, closes) fired up at the buffet.\nHey, guys.\nWe were just talking, and we're sorry about earlier.\nOh, listen, I've been thinking about what you said, and maybe you're right.\nI want the woman that I bring to your wedding to be special.\nSpecial like... my wife.\n(laughing)\nBoth: We got married!\n(laughing)\nWhat?!\nYou got married!\nWell, look, you guys said to be more serious, and nothing's more serious than holy matrimony.\nI mean, this is what you guys wanted, right?\nNo! No! This is insane.\nAnd we were totally out of bounds in the first place.\nWe never should have interfered in your love life.\nNo.\nGot you again!\nBoom!\nThat's what we needed to hear.\nHuh? Wait. What?\nWhat, so you... wait a minute.\nYou're not actually married?\n(laughing)\nOh, thank... thank goodness.\nIt was... it was just a prank.\nIt was just a prank. Okay.\nJust a prank.\nHow did you guys get such a realistic marriage certificate?\nDoes it look realistic?\nOh, that's good. They did a good job on it, 'cause it's a hundred percent real.\nWe got you.\nWe found a same-day chapel, and then we got married, as a prank.\nWha-uh...?\nSo-so you really did get married?\nY'all can't keep up.\nHow is really getting married, Winston, a prank?\nThe authenticity of the marriage is what makes it a great prank.\nCome on, guys.\nYeah.\nSays who?\nHold on. wh... no, please.\nLet them explain. Please explain.\nWe've already explained it.\nA simple prank is a strong prank.\nUh-huh.\nOkay.\nLet's just say... I don't know, I told you that I cut my pinkie finger off, and then I actually cut my pinkie finger off.\nRhonda: Mm.\nIs that a prank?\nIs that a prank?\nWell, I would not see that coming.\nOkay.\nDifferent direction.\nLet-let's say that I-I told you that I invested all of my money into boogie boards.\nThat's just a lie.\nAnd then I took you to my accountant's office, and sitting behind the desk was just a little crab in sunglasses.\nHmm, still sounds like a lie.\nAnd then my real accountant came out and showed you the books and, in fact, I had invested all of money in boogie boards.\nThat's definitely a prank.\nYeah, that would get me.\nThat's-that's a good one.\nThat's crazy, yeah.\nThat's a good one.\nRhonda: That's a good one.\nI don't understand this.\nOkay, so this is like a lifelong prank?\nOh, no, no, we're getting it annulled tomorrow.\nOh, right.\nRhonda: Tonight's the honeymoon.\nListen, a little marriage advice...\nI would know because I'm married... a happy wife, uh, a happy life.\nHave you heard the saying before?\nMm.\nI'm questioning everything right now.\nI swear, I swear... I swear...\nHe's about 5'10\".\nMaybe a mustache.\nSometimes he just sits in the bathroom buying music.\nDo you think you could check in there?\nIs that him in the RV?\nOh, no.\nHe wouldn't be in an RV.\nHe is, he is. That's him in the RV.\nYou look natural behind the wheel of that baby.\nI felt like myself for the first time in my life.\nJess: Hey, Jeff.\nWhere were you, and why weren't you answering your unit?\nExcuse me.\nExcu... yeah.\nGood stuff, Billy. Thank you.\nOw.\nIs this you doing your plan?\nI don't know.\nHe keeps changing things up.\nHe's very good at his job.\nHey, how ya doin'? I'm Jeff Day.\nMy brother.\nGeoff with a \"G.\"\nYeah, I came as soon as I could.\nJess: I don't know why.\nI explicitly told you not to.\nNick: Yeah, why don't you take a hike? No one needs you here.\nThe reason she came to me first.\nSorry, Billy.\nThere's a little bit of bad blood between my brother and my husband.\nShe may have come to you for help, but you're clearly not getting the job done, which is why she'll always come back for my help.\nAs soon as you get a helping of my help, you're never the same.\nNo one helps me better than I help myself.\nI told you if you'd just guide me.\nLet's not get into that now.\nI don't really know what you guys are talking about, but are you still buying the RV?\nNo! I'm not buying an RV.\nHoney, he's giving us a great price.\nWhy don't you get those numbers?\nDon't get those numbers.\nWhy don't you go get them?\nStay right there.\nWhy do women always bring your drama in here?\nOh, you're blaming me?\nHah! All right.\nI'd like to test-drive my car right now.\nI showed you where all the mirrors are, right?\n(engine revs)\n(Sam and Nick screaming)\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\n(all yelling at once)\nNow you guys are listening to me!\nGet ready for the scariest test-drive of your lives.\n Simply the best... \nI don't care if you're hot.\nI'm always cold!\nNick: Slow down!\nSam: Oh, man, this speed..."}, {"title": "05x16 - Helmet.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nGood night, Sam.\nUh, you got any place I can put this change?\nFahboh heh-mah.\n[garbled by mouth guard]: All right, sorry.\nI thought we had, uh, wrapped up the talking portion of the evening.\nUh, football helmet.\nYou're a Bears fan?\nOh, you know, sometimes in life we collect things. Trinkets.\nSome sentimental, some not.\nNick gave it to me. Is that, is that weird?\nN-n-no, that's fine. I, uh, can't really believe I'm saying this, 'cause Nick being in your life has definitely been hard for me, but I'm getting used to it.\n[garbled by mouth guard]: That makes me so happy.\nHey, this is gonna sound crazy, but my parents are in town tomorrow, and I thought maybe you could come meet them.\nYes, I'd love that.\nGood. You know, family's real important to me, and before I introduce you, I just wanted to make sure that we were solid.\nWe are so solid.\n[gasps]\n[quietly]: Cece.\n[quietly]: I had a sex dream.\nSo?\n[quietly]: It was about Nick.\n[whisper-yell]: No!\n[whisper-yell]: I know!\n \nWhere are my leftovers?\nWhat? Who cares?\nI care. I brought it up.\nI left perfectly nice leftovers in the fridge, and I expect them to be there.\nWell, now they're not.\nEnd of discussion.\nNo.\nMiddle of discussion.\nYou're not even gonna look at me?\nWhen you throw away my stuff, you're throwing me away.\nMm-hmm.\nI wanted to have cold scallop pizza for breakfast and you took that from me.\nYou took that from me.\nI hope you can live with yourself.\nYou're disgusting.\nI'm actually really happy that you're eating breakfast, Nick.\nIt's nice to know that you're taking care of yourself.\nThank you.\nWell, I'm on my way to meet Aly and her boyfriend for brunch.\n[laughing]: And I am super excited to meet him.\nYeah, that was sarcasm.\nAnd this is shark-casm: I just hate eating people.\nDear Lord, do you mean to tell me that you're going to brunch with the woman that you love and her boyfriend?\nThat's the worst thing I've ever heard.\nNo, it's not that bad. I mean, I'm in a prank marriage, anyway.\nAnd I'm over Aly, so...\nDon't you lie to me, Winston.\nI'm not lying.\nYou and both know that you are not even a little bit over Aly.\nI'm coming with you.\nAll right, fine, Schmidt, you can come.\nBut please, do me a favor?\nDon't be weird and start smelling people's bread.\nEither you eat bread, or you don't eat bread.\nThere's nothing in between, man.\nSo in the dream, what was Nick...\nHe was wearing this.\nHe was wearing a frickin' football helmet.\nAh, damn.\nWhat happened next was primal.\nMan versus woman.\nThe ancient battle of the flesh.\nCalm down. It's probably just happening because you're getting more serious with Sam.\nYes.\nAnd Sam is finally, just a little bit, sort of, starting to trust me.\nAnd he wants me to meet his parents.\nYou can't meet a man's parents if your ex is making love to you in your head.\nI need my mind Nick-free by tonight.\nOn this bed is everything Nick gave me while we were together.\nI'm going to get rid of it to clear my subconscious.\nAll right.\nGood-bye, sex helmet.\nGood-bye, uh, lacquered bagel with my name on it.\nGood-bye, world's tiniest hedgehog.\nThat was a gift?\nGood-bye almost done Rubik's Cube.\nLiterally, it was one turn from the end and he would not finish it.\nThat makes sense with Nick.\nPeople try to pretend like the brain is so complicated, but I feel better already.\nWell, the two most important men in my life are finally meeting.\nAnd for some reason this other guy's here.\nYo.\nHey, brunch is on me today, guys, okay?\nSo, feel free to add blue cheese to anything.\nI'm an agent for animal actors.\nHe's doing pretty good.\nHe recently signed the crow from Game of Thrones.\nDarnell. You know his name.\nDarnell. That's right.\nI didn't realize an animal agent was a real job.\nLet me put it to you this way, so the next Avatar movie takes place on a cat planet, and, uh, I was the first one they called.\nShut up.\nI know.\nI knew you were gonna like that.\nA cat planet?\nI know. He swore me to secrecy.\nI was gonna tell you.\nMy good... you know, I always thought Furguson should be in the movies.\nWould you interested in, uh, I don't know, taking a meeting with him?\nHe's got no representation, so he's...\nLet me guess. Wait. He has an adorable yawn?\nYeah.\nOf course he does.\nHe's a cat.\nBut can he show up every day to work?\nI run a business. Pass.\nYeah, never mind. Dumb idea.\nTripp, you have got to sit down with Furguson.\nHe's literally one of the most beautiful creatures I've ever laid eyes on.\nReally? I thought you hated him.\nI thought you hated cats in general, actually.\nI love Furguson, are you kidding me? It's Furguson.\nHe's got that, uh... he's got the little, uh, his, uh...\nYou know, his front?\nDoes he have a headshot?\nNo, but W-Winston, actually does have a lot of 8x10 photos of the cat's face.\nAll right, fine. Bring him by my office.\nCan't miss it. It's the tallest building in Beverly Hills.\nHey, hey, hey. Where'd you get that?\nI got this from the shoulder-less Dutch boy you live with.\nJess?\nPossibly.\nThat's mine. Why are they throwing away my stuff?\nThey're throwing away me. Give it back.\nAll right, but my babies come with it.\nI don't want your rock babies.\nWell, I'll just keep 'em.\nOkay.\n[rock clattering]\nSorry, Leviticus.\nHe's tough.\nWhy is everyone throwing away my stuff?\nFirst of all, that is not your helmet.\nYou gave that to me.\nAnd second of all, I need a clean house.\nI need a clean room. A clean mind.\nYeah, dirty room, dirty dreams.\nNo dirty dreams. No one had dirty dreams.\nWhat are you talking about? No dirty dreams.\nSo there has been dirty dreams?\nNo.\nWhat'd you have a dream about?\nIt's interesting, Jessica. What was it about?\nThere was no dream, dude.\nWell, which one of you is gonna crack and tell me what the dream was about? Jess?\nOr Cece?\nYou looked at the helmet.\nCece!\nI did not. I did not.\nYou had a sex dream about a Bear's helmet?\nWho was wearing it? Ditka?\nVic Fangio? John Fox?\nOur GM, Ryan Pace?\nHe's cute, but come on.\nShe doesn't know any of those people, Nick.\nCece!\nSo...\nShe doesn't know those people.\nSo it was somebody you know.\nThere wasn't... No. Absolutely not. No.\nOh, my God.\nYou had a sex dream about me.\nNo.\nIt was... no... there was no...\nWell, well, well, well, well.\nThanks a lot, Cece.\nThat was my bad. I'm sorry.\nPancakes and syrup, girls.\nLet's eat.\nNick, I have to meet Sam's parents tonight.\nI don't have time for this.\nWhat will it take for you to just forget about this and get rid of the helmet?\nOh, just every single detail about the dream.\nDamn.\nNow, and this one is a biggie, was I 100% percent human?\nWhat?\nObviously.\nOkay, I'm just trying to figure out the reality of the dream.\nWell, we were having sex, so in that sense, it was not reality-based at all, because that's never gonna happen again.\nOh!\nYou sound like the beginning of a Salt-N-Pepa song, and I just wish we could just, like, act like adults.\nDefinitely, definitely, definitely, definitely.\nWere you just recreating our best encounter?\nWas it Glove City again?\nOur best was not Glove City.\nOh, it wasn't?\nIt was for you, but not for me.\nSo what was our best, in your opinion?\nOoh, you just walked right into that one.\nOkay, it wasn't something that actually happened.\nIt was historical.\nOh, historical, so was there a dragon?\nNo, it was historical.\nYou think dragons are real?\nI think there's a lot of debate about it.\nAnd there's a lot of blogs about it.\nAnd I know that as a fact, 'cause I've written one.\nDo you think dinosaurs are dragons?\nThere's debate about dragons, Jess, and we're not doing this right now.\nWow, this office is nice.\nM... look, this is so nice of you, man.\nYou didn't really have to come.\nOf course, I came.\nI believe in yo... I believe in Furguson.\nIs that offer a joke? Huh?\nBecause I will feed you to my eagle.\n'Sup. Let's talk puss.\nReady to show me your hairy little guy?\nWhat?\nUgh.\nOh. Yes, uh...\nIntroducing...\nThe mouse murderin', the heart burglarin', the king of the kennel, Furguson Michael Jordan Bishop.\n[Furguson purring]\nHe's lickin' his no-no.\nAmerica's sweetheart.\nAll right. This is catnip oil.\nThe professional cats don't need it to come out of the box.\n[Furguson purring]\nWho's a good cat?\nWho's a good cat?\nWho's a good cat?\nNot you. This cat doesn't have it.\nWhat?\nLet me show you something.\nThis is a star.\nThis is Patches.\n \nIf you find yourself at the intersection of Grace and Courage, look up. The street sign says, \"Patches.\" She is \"bang, marry, kill\" in one furry little package. You want to own her. Run to her. Run from her.\n \nWow.\nMost of all, you want to watch her.\nPatches is a trash cat.\nThis is who you take to the Avatar audition.\nThis is sexy.\nAnd this? This is normal.\nAnd normal doesn't pay for the cruise in the Arctic that I'm taking Aly on.\nUnless I sign a baby walrus and then the whole thing's a write-off.\nThat was humiliating.\nYeah, for Tripp.\nBecause Furguson is gonna book Avatar.\nI stole the script off of his desk.\nWe're gog to crash that audition today.\nOh.\nHi.\nHey.\nOh, uh, two, please.\nYou got it.\n[elevator bell dings]\n[sighs]\nWhat's his name?\nJosh.\nSo your football helmet was caked in soot.\nWhy was I a chimney sweep?\nWell, a chimney is hollow and you're just like jamming something into it.\nWhat does that have to do with sex?\nGet a hold of yourself.\nSorry.\nSo you took me to a dark, Victorian alley.\nIt was filthy. I was on top.\nOkay, I'm okay with that.\nOur passion drowns out the coughs from the orphans inside.\nAnd then Winston brings us scones.\nAnd that's it.\nReally sweet of him.\nI'm starving after sex, especially when I have to lay on my back.\nYou're starving all the time.\nWho invited you in this room?\nJess: All right?\nAre we good? Can we get rid of the helmet?\nI'm concerned, as a friend, that Sam isn't satisfying you sexually.\nI can confidently say that's not what this is about.\nMaybe he's just not rotating your tires enough, Jess.\nWhat?\nYou know you need that at least once a month.\nNick.\nFor sex, that's not enough.\nAnd for literal tire rotation, that's way too frequent.\nNot when you drive like I do.\nNot... when you drive like I do.\nI have to get ready to meet Sam's parents.\nWill you please get out of here?\nYes. I'm leaving, but I will not throw away this helmet.\nWhy? You didn't care about that helmet when you gave it to me?\nYes, I did. It was a Christmas gift.\nI gave you a Christmas present, and you said, Christmas? What? Hold up.\nAnd then you went and got that helmet.\nUnwrapped.\nWhat was I supposed to do with it?\nWear it?\nI wouldn't do...\nOh, the perfect ensemble for a night at the theater.\nThrow whatever you want at me, Blue Men.\nI'm ready.\n\n\n\n[knocking at door]\nOh, crap. That's Sam. Ugh.\nOkay, why won't this come off?\nProbably because it's a child-size medium.\nWhat?!\nWhy would you give me a child's helmet?\nI didn't think you were gonna put it on.\nCece, help me, help me.\nYeah, I got it.\nI can't meet Sam's parents like this.\nOkay, ready? [groans]\nNick: It's not going to help.\nOkay, no, it's-it's really stuck, babe.\nSuck your head in.\nI can't suck my head in.\nThen throw a jersey on and pants, and just pretend you're a little football player.\nI can't go out with a helmet.\nYou look ridiculous.\nI'm aware.\n\nCece, can you go out there and stall Sam?\nHe knows that Nick gave me this helmet [knocking] and he can't see me in it.\nOkay, what's my lie? Chlamydia?\nNo! No! Anything else. Literally, anything else.\nOkay, anything else, okay.\nHey, hey, Legs.\nWhat's up?\nYou and I have never really clicked, huh?\n[cats meowing]\nOh, boy.\nWow.\nOh, my God.\nPatches is walking like a person.\nThis was a enormous mistake.\nIs it, um, hard being a doctor?\nYeah.\nOh.\nWhat's taking Jess so long?\nGet! Off!\nStop, you're gonna break it.\nMy! Head!\nWhatever. I'll buy you a new one.\n[grunting]\nYou can't.\nMy dad gave it to me.\nYou gave me something that your dad gave you?\nWell... I just used it to put dirty change in.\nWhy didn't you tell me?\nI don't like talking about emotional stuff, especially about my dead father.\nNo, I... yeah.\nI get it. I get... I get it as much as someone who has two, living, healthy parents can.\nEasy.\nOh, God, I'm sorry.\nThat was... was that too harsh?\nI just... I'm messing everything up.\nYou know what? I'm just gonna tell Sam everything, and I'll see what happens.\nNo.\nI think I know how to get it off.\nOkay, run backwards.\nYeah, it's not working.\nIt's not working.\nYou run backwards.\n[screaming]\n[screaming]\n[grunting]\nIt's moving. Rock with me.\nOkay.\nAll right. Well, don't stop.\n[yells]\nJess: You got to keep going. Do it harder.\nIf it slips out, tell me. I don't want to accidentally put it back in.\nDon't stop, Whatever you do, don't stop.\nJust relax.\nDon't stop.\n[yelling]\n[yelling]\nJess?\nOh.\nOh. No, no. There was a scallop pizza...\nNo, I was mad at Nick, and it was in the fridge. so I put the helmet on.\nSchmidt threw it away.\nWhat is going on here?\nOkay, um...\n[groans]\nI had a sex dream about Nick.\nLet me back up.\nLast night, you asked me about this helmet.\nSorry. Let me fast forward.\nThe helmet's stuck on my head.\nLook, I know this is a lot to ask, but is there any way, you could just trust me when I tell you that it was just a stupid sex dream.\nOkay, yes. Yeah, no. I trust you.\nThank you.\nBut right now, my parents are expecting us.\nSo, you know, a lot of kids come into the hospital with stuff stuck on their head.\nDo you guys have a screwdriver or a hammer?\nOh, uh, we can't break it 'cause...\nNick's dad gave it to him.\nRight. Uh, well...\nI have to go meet my parents, so I'll call you tomorrow.\nHey. What are you doing out here, man?\nI'm sorry I got us into this, Winston.\nThat frickin' cat's a genius. Yeah.\nI don't want to humiliate your cat.\nI care about Furguson. I don't want...\nI don't want that poor thing to be humiliated.\nHey, hey, hey.\nI can't imagine his self-esteem level already.\nIt's got to be very low.\nThrough the frickin' roof, the self-esteem.\nDon't worry about Furguson, okay?\nOkay, I can't do this anymore.\nAre we talking about Furguson, or are we talking about you?\nWe're talking about me, okay?\nI knew it.\nFurguson is me. Patches is Tripp, all right?\nI knew... we've been dancing around that all day.\nCan we please go?\nI haven't eaten anything in six hours.\nYou know what? No.\nPatches may know a lot of tricks, but you know how Furguson's gonna get Aly?\nI think you're getting lost, Winston, but keep going.\nHe's gonna keep trying, okay?\nHe's never gonna give up.\nThat's his trick.\nNow come on, man. Let's get back in there.\nCome on.\nCome on.\nAll right.\nLet's go.\nYeah, no. Let's do this.\nLet's go.\n \nWhat are you guys doing here?\nWait a second.\nYou're not auditioning that housecat, are you?\nOh, that is exactly what I'm doing.\nTripp, can I borrow that catnip oil just for a sec?\nSure, but I think you know very well it's not going to help you in there.\nWe'll see about that.\nOh, my God.\nThat stuff is so concentrated. What are you doing?\n[meow]\nAha!\n[Patches meowing]\nIt looks like Patches is gonna have a little trouble concentrating on her audition.\n[people shouting]\n[stammering]\nGod save me.\nFurguson, avenge me!\nAvenge me!\n[cats meowing]\nI need a straw.\nUgh, I should be charming the pants off Sam's parents right now.\nJess.\nWe're gonna break it.\nBut what about your dad?\nLook, it sucks to admit, but Sam's a really good guy with above average handsomeness.\nAnd he's above six feet tall, which I know means a lot to you.\nAnd he makes you happy, and so...\nI think it's time for me to stop coming in between you guys.\nLet's do this. Let's have a little bit of fun, huh?\n[clattering]\nI will be going on the count of three.\nOne, zero, two, three, four...\nWhat are you doing?\nYou never go on three.\nYou want to catch the patient off guard.\nIt's less scary that way.\nEverybody knows it. It's just a doctor trick.\nNick. So this time I am going on three.\nOne, two, three, four...\nDo it!\n[Nick and Jess yelling]\nSo this is the famous Patches.\nNo. I am...\nWinston L'andre Bishop and this is: the king of cats.\nLover of mats.\nNo friend of rats.\nThe kitty from Angel City, Furguson Michael Jordan...\nBishop.\n[laughs]\n[meows]\n[laughing]\nHe just, poof...\nI'm gonna try to settle him down. and disappeared.\n[laughter continues]\n What would you do if your son was at home \n Crying all alone \n On the bedroom floor \nOh, my God, he's singing to the cat.\nCome on.\nHe's singing to the cat.\nLet's get out of here.\nIt's okay. We're here. We're here.\nOkay, Patches is here.\nI was four steps away from freedom [sighs] and I fell.\nOh, they were on me, and they traversed me.\nIt was like I was their city and they were all rushing to work.\nMay I just please take a moment with Patches?\nShe needs a, a moment to center herself.\nShe almost OD'd on catnip.\nForget about Patches.\nYou should represent more cats like Furguson.\nWhat?\nWhat? You were laughing at him.\nHe's an original.\nMakes Patches look like a Culkin brother.\nWhat?!\n[laughing]\nIt's hard to celebrate this moment with so much cat hair in my mouth.\nYou did it, buddy.\nReally? Really? Now you're gloating?\nHuh? Winston?\nAh.\nDo you have to be such a dick?\nI mean, you're already so intimidating.\nDo you have to go out of your way to actually get at me?\nIntimidating?\nAly talks about you all the time, obviously.\nYou're a cop. You're a hero.\nLast weekend, I went to a turtle's birthday party.\nThis is oddly emotional.\nYou're intimidated by me?\nYes.\nIt's funny how life works, man. It's ironic.\nThis is amazing.\nYou know what, Tripp?\nYou don't have to worry about Furguson competing with Patches.\nYeah.\nI'm taking him out of the game.\nI don't like this life for him.\nOh, yeah!\nYou blew it, son.\nOh, God, am I unhappy.\nI'm casting cats.\n[Patches meows]\nHi.

I love letters.\nI know, me too.\nWe have so much in common.\nArguably too much.\nMm.\nBut keep going.\nWell... Sam never responded.\n[scoffs]\nI just figured he didn't want to embarrass me, you know?\nI mean, I-it's hard when you're friends with a guy first.\nSo... he came home, and we just kept on like normal, and it was really painful, but I-I couldn't lose him as a friend.\nOf course you couldn't.\nThen... last week, this came in the mail.\n[gasps]\n\"Return to sender.\"\nHe never got it.\nOh, my God.\nYeah.\nHe never knew how you felt.\nNo, and I-I came here tonight to give him this letter and then...\nWhat happened?\nI met you.\nOh, right.\nMe.\nMm.\nHere.\nI can't throw it away, but I can't give it to him.\nDon't worry, Jess, you... you didn't do anything wrong.\nI'm not the one for Sam.\nYou are.\nI'm gonna be really honest.\nUm, I'm having a-a very hard time rooting for myself right now.\nThat was the most romantic story I've ever heard.\nAnd I don't want to get between them.\nOr do I?\nI love Sam, and I don't want to throw it all away because she couldn't figure out how to buy a Forever stamp.\nJust because you give Sam this letter, it does not mean that he's automatically gonna choose Diane.\nYeah. Yeah.\nYeah.\n[scoffs] Damn it.\nLook at them.\n\n\n\n Moon river \n Wider than a mile \n I'm crossing you in style... \nThis song isn't even on our jukebox.\nYou know what, that's it.\nI'm-I'm not losing Sam because I'm some dumb romantic.\nCece, get rid of this letter.\nLett'r done.\nGood-bye, Diane.\nGo back to fixing feet, you sweet saint of a woman.\nYou must be so proud of me.\nI'm finally being practical and realistic, and not some moony-eyed freak who's seen too many romantic comedies.\nI'm basically being you.\nNot anymore, pal.\nSchmidt's made me weak in my stupid knees.\nI don't know.\nThis past year with Schmidt's changed me.\nIt's made me believe in love stories.\nIs that why you were crying during the bank commercial where the two old people were texting each other?\nJessica...\nI know.\nThey now have the money that they need...\nNo, I know... to be buried together.\n[laughs]\nWe both know that you're not gonna be able to live with yourself if you don't give this letter to Sam.\nYeah.\nWhat if I lose him?\nWell, then you'll at least know, babe.\nIt's not your love story.\nOh.\nI have something to tell you.\nThe old man in the bank commercial, um, played a Nazi in Schindler's List.\nDoes that change anything?\nSchmidt: I made a model of our wedding venue.\nNick: Wow.\nYour wine is so good, I really want to showcase it and-and put the bar here.\nIt's where they store the drums of wild chemicals, but I'm pretty sure they're empty now.\nYeah, it's empty except for the big puddle that never dries.\nGavin: Oh, it'll be fine.\nWith your mother there, that puddle will get drunk.\nHow about we grab some dinner?\n[chuckles] Together?\nYou...\nYeah, no, I'd like that very much.\nI'm gonna run home.\nObviously, I can't wear these shoes to dinner.\nHa, can you imagine?\nI'll see you.\nI'm going to dinner with my dad.\n[door closes]\nThis is so great, man.\nYeah, it's great.\nYou guys are finally getting along.\nYou were like, \"We've been down this road.\"\nIt's great.

Okay.\nHey, babe?\n[groans]\nI think we got this, okay?\nYes.\nWe got this.\nActually, we, we got this.\nPreach! We got this.\nJess, look at us for a second, the two of us, Cece and I.\nWe. Us.\nBoth: We got this.\nWe got this.\n[chuckles]: All right.\nSchmidt, bedrooms. Cece, bathrooms.\nI'm gonna smell everything.\nBonjour! Crawdaddy's home, and he's ready to see his crawkids!\nWho's home?\nSchmidty, Jess?\nWinston?\nWinston's cat?\nFine. Cece?\n\nThe en suite is en fleek.\nI love this house, too.\nI poked my head in the shower.\nPerfect, gentle, unrelenting pressure.\nLike when my mom made me rehearse my haftarah portion.\nI don't know, guys.\nLot of lost dog posters around.\nReally sad neighborhood.\nAlso it's crazy expensive.\nI'm the voice of reason, that's why you brought me with.\nWe-we didn't bring you with.\nYou followed us here in your car.\nOkay.\nShe followed us the whole way.\nI know, I know.\nCece, I'm begging you, please tell her to go home.\nYeah, I know.\nWe need to start setting some boundaries.\nYou know what, though? She's not wrong.\nThis place is way over our borrowing limit.\nDamn it. [Sighs]\nThe only place that was even close was that...\nBoth: Carpet house.\nAll right. We will ask for a bigger loan.\nAnd It'll be tight, but we'll manage it.\nOkay.\nYeah, we can do it.\nLook, we'll just make sacrifices.\nYeah.\nWe'll pack our lunches.\nWe'll cut out cup-on's.\nIt's coupons.\nCup-ons, yeah.\nNo, you're saying cup-ons.\nWell, it's fine.\nIt's not important, we'll cut out cup-ons.\nCoupons.\nBut if we're gonna do this, we're gonna have to go to the bank now because this house is gonna go like this, I know it.\nWhy is she talking to the realtor?\nI will handle it, okay?\nIt's-it's tot... it's... Oh.\nJess?\nI'm so sorry, do you mind if I just steal her away for a minute? Jessica?\nHey, honey, this can't happen.\nYou're right, this is not your house.\nToni-Anne, we're walking!\nNo, no.\nYou being here.\nYou taking over as our real estate agent because... you can't stop thinking about Nick.\nCece, not everything's about Nick.\nCurvando diante da face errada.\nIn Portuguese, \"You're bending before the wrong face.\"\nAgain, very sexual language.\nYou know I love you and I will always be there for you in an emergency, but Schmidt and I need to do this by ourselves.\nYou got to go home.\nOkay. I got it. Okay.\nYou guys are moving forward, You don't need ol' Jess the Mess.\nI'm gonna go home.\nBut seriously, I crawled under the house and the retrofitting is rookie work.\nOkay.\nShe going home?\nYeah, let's go to the bank.\nLet's do it. You know what, actually, I just want to use the cooktop first.\nMake an egg.\nHoney, where are you gonna get an egg?\nGot two eggs right here.\nGot a pan right here.\nThink I'm gonna buy a house and not make an egg first?\nAnd I'm a Sagittarius, which is why I'm so good with people and horses.\nBut it also makes me, like, really sleepy.\nUh, Leslie... [nervous laugh]\nUm, there's no... there's no easy way to say this.\nUh... you... no longer work... for Schmidt and Cece.\nNo, no, they're firing me?\nNo, but didn't you tell them how good I am?\nWell, you know, I tried to.\nI was like, I was like, \"Man, she good...\"\nYou didn't stick up for me, Winston?\nWell, I tried...\nI'm calling Aly!\nHey, hey, hey, hey.\nHey, no, no, time out, time out.\nListen, hey, hey, hey.\nTime out. Stop.\nStop that.

I'm buying a home.\n[horns honking]\nWe do not look great on paper.\nPlease, on paper, we're as ugly as Winston's bellybutton ring.\nWho gets a bellybutton ring if you have an outie?\nAnd at 33, no less.\nBut trust me, loan officers have a lot of discretion.\nWe just need to market ourselves.\nWe need to look him right in the eye...\nMr. Schmidt and Mrs. Parikh?\nI'm not blind.\nI just had my pupils dilated for an exam.\nIf it makes you feel any better, I'm seeing stars, too.\nWhat?\nI'm talking about you.\nOkay, honey, just... shh.\nShh. You're a big, bright star.\nIt ain't gonna be that kind of party today, pal.\nFollow me.\n[exhales]\n\n\n\nNick [muffled]: Hey, Crawdaddy's home!\n[coughs]\nI had a whole crawdaddy thing, but I... the point is, I'm home.\n[clears throat]\nHey, Nick.\nYou weren't supposed to be home for, like, a month.\nAre you guys doing okay?\nYeah, uh, Reagan's drug company is moving her up to Seattle...\nOkay. so we're doing the distance thing.\nYeah, we're doing great.\nYou know what they call Seattle in Portland?\nNorth Portland.\nOr, uh, Vancouver's Shoe.\nWhat?\nVancouver's Shoe.\n[chuckles]\nGet in here!\nGive me a hug!\nOkay.\nAll right!\nWow, look at you.\nYou got jacked. Yeah.\nWhat, did you go to prison?\n[chuckles]\n[laughs] No.\nI worked out a lot.\nCome on, sit down.\nI haven't seen you in months.\nI need some Jess.\nI also have something very important to tell you.\nIs everything okay?\nUm...\nI have to, um...\nIt's just, I have to meet my friend.\nI mean, I have to go to the zoo.\nThe zoo?

Deedee.\nI have to meet Deedee.\nShe's, like, a good friend.\n\"Deedee\"?\nThat's not a name.\nYou have one friend.

I said it.\n[sighs]\nI saw him for one second and I freaked out.\nI told him I was going to the zoo.\nBoth: You hate the zoo.\nThere's something about him.\nI see him and my heart explodes.\nWe all need to meet new people.\nOh...\n[seagulls squawking]\nWhere are we?\nYour new hood!\nOkay, so, I couldn't check all the boxes, but I think nailed the most important one: That it can float.\nThat's a... that's a boat.\nYeah.\nI was just driving to my doctor's office last night and I saw it.\nAnd you thought, \"Okay.\"\nWhere-where's your doctor's office?\nThree boats down.\nShould we call Aly and tell her the good news?\nI had no idea you were going through this.\nI can't even be in the same room as Nick.\nI don't know what I'm saying and what if I say something that ruins our friendship?\nGet out.\nWhat?\nGet out. Get out right now.\nGet out instantly.\nWhat?\nWhat happened to the \"I'm so sorry\"?\nNick is on his way to the bank right now. I texted him.\nI need his help with the loan.\nWhat?\nWhat?\nWe need to put the bar up for collateral, okay?\nWe're miles past our borrowing limit. It's the only way.\nYeah, but the bar?\nNo time. There he is.\nWhat?\nSchmidt: Hey, Nick!\nAh!\n[laughing]\nJust pretend like we're having a normal conversation.\nOh, God. Oh, God.\nOkay. Um...\nThis is, um, this is Margaret.\nThis is Gracie.\nOh.

That's my sister.\nAnd I know she's an idiot.\n[exhales] Thank God.\nJust because we're long-distance doesn't mean we can't be real with each other.\nOkay?\nWe have to tell each other everything.\n[sighs]\nI don't know what the word \"panache\" means.\nIt means having a certain kind of flair.\nThat...\nAll right, I'm gonna hang up now.\nAre you ready?\nOf course I'm ready.

Then organize it.\nNo.\n\n\n\n[phones ringing]\n[singsongy]: I'm-a make a system.\nI couldn't see the smug look on Schmidt's face, but I could feel it.\nI'll be damned if I cast a vote for Bishop-Furguson.\nWait, where-where are you going?\nBack to the coven of Greek sirens.\nI say we go in hard, with the violent history of the suffragette, and then, we ease into some light reproductive rights.\nThat is one way to do it.\nOr...\nWho's ready to party?\nAnd gab about the kind of world we want to leave our grandchildren!\nHopefully one that's full of parties!\n[cheering]\nYou're gonna graduate soon, okay?\nSo, this is your turn to really speak up and make a difference...\nAnd it's your turn to drink!\nOh, okay.

He was not single-shaming you.\nI-I wasn't...\nThat was not his intention at all.\nI don't even know what that is.\nCouples always try to talk down to singles.\nWe can do everything that you guys can do.\nI take myself out for a dessert date every Sunday.\nYeah, and yesterday, I had a backache, and I rubbed it myself, in a doorjamb.\nThis is bummin' me out.\nIs this group gonna be a bummer? Be honest.\nAbsolutely not.\nThere's Brenda.\nShe's a circuit court judge who also teaches taxidermy class for kids.\nAnd Hugh. He grows his own onions.\nMy former boss and current friend, Principal Foster.\nHis hip surgeon has okayed him for sex, but he hasn't okayed himself.\nAnd of course, Robby, our leader.\nHave you ever seen a group more ready to have fun with themselves?\n[cheering]\n[horse hooves clopping]\nJust look at this view; we needed this so badly.\nIt's-it's perfect.\nIs it, though?\n[camera shutters clicking]\nCan you stop hogging the vista?\nThere are other people who would like to take a photo.\nI don't want to lose this light.\nIt's a traditional high-noon.\nDon't couple-splain light to us.\nIt just seems like it would be easier if you guys took a group photo.\nWe actually need a picture for our web site, Oh, yeah.\nSo, all right, you can take a group photo.\nAll right, let's do this.\nNow, I'm only taking one shot, so if the first one's a silly one, you're gonna have to live with a silly one.\nOkay. One, two, three. There we go. Great photo.\nI'm gonna need one, too.\nActually, we're all gonna need one.\nWhat?\nYeah, we don't share phones like you people.\nWho shares phones?\nHow would we call each other?\nI don't know.\nI can't do this. This is... Take these back.\nYou guys are ruining a perfectly good vista moment.\nCan't you go someplace else and enjoy being single?\n[gasps] Did you just quote-hands enjoy being single to us?\nYou guys are telling each other that you're happy being this, when we all know that you would rather be this.\nNo. This is jazz hands, the end of an explosive musical number.\nThis is O.J. trying to put on the bloody glove.\nThis is freedom!\nThis is flying!\nThis is praying that you can go back to this!\nThis is high fives for everybody!\nAll around! Yes! [chuckling]\nLet's go to the lake, guys. Bye.\nFoster: I call dibs on the slime-free part.\nOkay.\nJust enjoy the view.

What does no notes even mean?!\nNo notes.\nNo notes?\nCome on.\n[chuckles]\nNick, I'm communing with nature, and I'm almost at peace.\nWhat do you want?\nNo notes?\nSeriously?\nIt is just so nice to get out of the city and watch TV.\nWhat about this dumb thing? When Pepperwood just watches a block of local news.\nOh, I found that part to be gutting, Nick. I mean, the irony that Pepperwood's violent world is being translated into sound bites for mass consumption...\nThat's just me transcribing Channel 3 News!\nI didn't even change the anchors' names!\nIt's called realism, Nick.\nNo.\nGood-bye, genius.\nNo!\n[groans]\nOoh, that was... Ooh.\nWinston: Oh, my gosh.\n13 times.\nYeah. It's a lot of times.\nA lot of times.\n[chuckles] I had a good time.\nI had a great time.\nI could've gone so many more times than that.\nYeah, that's actually nothing.\n[both chuckle]\nI could go all night, girl.\nI could go tens of... so many more times.\nTens of... Ten... Yeah.\nCool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.\n[sighs] Cool, cool, cool, cool.\nThat's what's up.

Okay.\nWhat does he want?\nI'm in crisis right now. Could you read my book and give me notes, please?\nOh, man. I don't want to take a break.\nMmm. Mm-mm.\nI'm like a freight train right now.\nI can't slow down.\nMe either.\nThis is crisis!\nBut...\nGuys, supporting our friend's artistic endeavors is also insanely...\nHey, guys. Guys, pay attention.\nIt's sexy.\nThis is crisis.\nBut I was thinking the same thing.\nOh, thank God.\nHello? Winston! Winston, We could easily just both read the book you're supposed to be my friend.\nAt the same time, and then when we're done, just get right back at it.\nRight?\nYes, yes, yes, yes.\nGreat. Now, do y... do you guys want a PDF or do you want 100 individual JPEGs?\nJPEGs, JPEGs, J... JPEGs.\nUh, 100 individual JPEGs, please.\nYeah! This is gonna take forever.\n[laughing]\n[groans]\nFive-three.\n[grunts]\nHey. Oh, I was just... just playing a little single and sufficient badminton.\nWell, I hope you worked up an appetite, because I'm gonna make my Singles Sliders.\nOh, yeah?\nOkay, so what I do is I take the meat from three different sliders, and then I just sort of mash 'em into one big boy that stands on his own.\nOh. So, like a burger.\nYeah, it's like a burger except it's bigger.\nOh. Well, if it isn't Schmidt.\nOr should I call you Schmidt-tata 'cause you have so much egg on your face?\nYou little Italian egg omelet.\n[laughs, snorts] Nice.\nJess, what's happening in the lake over there?\nWait, is that a jellyfish?\nCome over here.\nOh, please, that's so much less sexual than the stuff that you and Nick do on a regular basis.\n[chuckles] Ow.\n[sighs]\nIt's happening.\nOkay, Robby...\nI'm on it.\n[Hugh and Brenda laughing]\nGuys, guys.\nNo, no, no, no, no. What are you doing?\nYou guys know that you can only be in this group if you're single, right?\nIt's tough.\nI'm very horny.\nI want you guys to be strong.\nLet's do the motto.\nI'm single I'm single and I'm sufficient.\nand I'm sufficient.\nDidn't sound like you meant it. One more.\nBoth: I'm single and I'm sufficient.\nYes.\nOne last time.\nI'm single and I'm sufficient!\nYes!\nFoster: Well, I just hope we don't see a repeat of that kind of behavior with me later on.\nYou were amazing out there. Your ability to dampen sexual chemistry is astounding.\n[chuckles softly]\nUh... [clears throat] Thanks.\nFoster: Hey, guys!\nI just caught a fish with my hand!\nWow. Nick's book is astonishing.\nI thought it was gonna take forever, but... it was perfect.\nHe really brings you into the world.\nEvery minor character is so well thought out.\nThe newsboy? You could see his whole life.\nAnd am I the only one who thought that the murderer's name was in the song?\nThe murderer's song was in the song!\nAh. So good.\nNo notes.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWell... sex?\nYes!\nYeah?\nsex.\nI'm ready if you're ready.\nYeah. Yeah.\nAll right.\nJust a short walk to our yurt.\nUnless we take the scenic route.\nOh. Nothing gets me in the mood like scenery.\nMmm?\nLet's do that.\nYeah, let's go that way.\nYeah, let's do that. The scenic way.\nPerhaps you could find the perfect bun if... I don't know... You had your glasses.\nOh. Oh, you know... you know who else has glasses?\nSix out of ten people in the developed world, including Robby and I?\nJess, just give over to it. We're happy for you.\nUse your yurt. You have a world-class yurt.\nYeah, and if this is about me and Robby dating years ago, trust me, it doesn't matter.\nMm-mm.\nWe only did hand stuff, per his neurosis, [groans] so you totally have my blessing.\nBlessing for what?\nThis.\nThat.\nGuys, I am not into Robby.\nAnd I could never date a guy who wears glasses because of the clown from my dreams.\nThe clown who wears glasses.\nOh, my God, that clown is me.\nI'm not dating Robby, okay?\nHey.\nOh, Robby.\nOh, hey, Robby.\nI heard my name a bunch of times. I mean, I could tell that you weren't trying to call me in here, but, uh, my curiosity kicked in, so... A couple of us are gonna wander down and, uh, you know, tell some stories and, uh... [plays guitar] sing a few songs.\nThat sounds great. Actually, you know who loves to sing?\nActually, I've really been hating music lately.\nCome on, Jess, you're a whore for singin'. Please.\n \n I hear the drums echoing tonight \n but she hears only \n whispers of some quiet conversation \n \n She's coming in, 12:30 flight \n The moonlit wings reflect the stars \n that guide me towards salvation... \n[phone ringing]\nDamn it!\nNick, if this is about notes, so help me God.\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna stop bugging you until you note me, Schmidt.\nAll right, Nick. Here's a note.\nStop cutting yourself off at the knees like a selfish coward.\nOkay, great, great. I love the direction we're going.\nWe're getting more critical, but can you refocus to the writing?\nNo, Nick, I cannot, and you want to know why?\nBecause you are a writer.\nAnd a damn good one at that.\nBut you're just too scared to admit it to yourself.\nGoodbye, sir.\nNo! Damn, you raven-haired dandy boy.\nYeah, thought carving our names in the trees would have taken longer.\nYeah.\n[owl hooting]\nSo... do you want... want to have sex?\nYeah. I think that's... Yeah, let's...\nListen, Aly, I got to admit, I'm pretty tapped out.\nI-I'm sorry to say it like that, but, you know, I'm...\nNo. Me, too! I know!\nWe've had too much sex too fast!\nWhy didn't we pace ourselves?\n[sighs]\nI'm so exhausted.\nOh, my gosh, I think this whole ordeal just illustrates why three months isn't three days.\nSo happy you said that.\n[laughs]\nI'm just happy to be in the same place as you.\nMe, too.\nAnd, you know, we did do it 13 times.\nThat's a lot.\nThat's a lot of times.\nBut you know what my favorite time was?\n11?

Where's the group?\nThe group is kind of permanently done.\nRobby sent out a final e-mail.\nIt was in Latin, uh, and it was in this gothic font.\nI'm kind of worried about him.\nWhy don't you give the guy a chance, Jess?\n[sighs] I'm not interested right now.\nSo, what, are you just gonna give up on love, be alone forever?

A-plus posture.\nI mean she's moving to L.A. next month.\nWhat do you think about Reagan as our roommate?\n'Cause she would live in my room, but she'd still pay rent.\nAnd then you could have that multipurpose room where you could shower and cook.\nWell, I'd still use the bathroom and the kitchen for showering and cooking, but I would use the multipurpose room for everything else, [chuckles] and I'd be living across the hall from my ex and his new girlfriend.\nNot sure why I said those two in the same tone.\nYou know what, forget it actually.\nI-I... That's on me.\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\nI didn't think of the ex-girlfriend thing.\nForget it.\nShe's a girl who we like, and she's lived there before.\nI know.\nAnd then that gets us out of the whole \"Here's what you need to know about Winston\" conversation.\nThat's always a long weekend.\nI know.\nShe would overlap with Schmidt and Cece.\nAnd six people is a violation of the loft agreement.\nBut loft agreements are reached to be amended.\nSo you're really okay with this?\nYes.\nI mean, that's how a normal person would say yes.\nI need the trademark Jessica Day yes.\nYes!\nOkay, that's a little bit too much.\nI think it's got to be somewhere in the middle.\nYe-yes.\nGreat. [chuckles]\nYeah.\nYou know, there is something so familiar about this room.\nI don't know. It's like I've been here before.\n[sighing]: Wow...\nCece: Babe, I know you were planning on doing all of the heavy lifting when it comes to decorating...\nInterior design.\nCece, this is a home. It's not a Christmas cookie.\nSo you've said.\nBut this is our first joint venture, and I really want to help.\nThe only thing better than realizing my interior design vision will be realizing our interior design vision.\nGreat. Okay, so this is what I'm seeing...\nA boar's head over the fireplace with a decorative pedestal backing.\nOr...\nHow did I know that?\n.. this color for our bathroom.\nWhat do you think?\nI love it.\nYou do? Because I know that our tastes haven't always jived.\n[doorbell playing \"La Cucaracha\"]\nYou think that we're greeting people in our home to \"La Cucaracha\"!\nThis is the paint swatch choice of a serious interior designer.\nYou should save that for when we renew our vows.\nI love you.\nBathroom's going to look great.\nHuh, that's a pretty color.\nOoh-ee, yes, it is.\nFor a third world doctor's office.\nI love this. What is this, yellow?\nSix words you never get to hear: Nick is calling a loft meeting.\nI call to order this off-site loft meeting.\nNick, you have the floor.\nI propose Reagan move into the loft.\nShe is a... likable girl who is not Coach.\nThank you very much for your time.\nAs cosponsor of this bill, it has my full and unconditional support.\nFull and unconditional support.\nToday, we will vote to amend the...\nNo More Than Five Damn People May Live in This Loft at Any One Time Act.\nFormerly the...\nNo More Than Four Damn People May Live in This Loft at Any One Time Act.\nWe will be voting as is our custom by secret ballot.\nThe vote must be unanimous.\nWhat'd you write?\nShh.\nOkay.\nThree yays, two nays?\nWhat?\nWhat the hell?!\nEven after my speech?\n[loud buzzing]\nI really thought this was gonna cheer me up.\nJess: Nick.\nI swear I voted yay.\n[turns off sander] I know.\nAnd it means a lot to me, because I really want her to move in.\nBut I don't have the votes. What can you do?\nYou're only short two votes.\nI can get you two votes.\nYou can do that?\nCan a shark ruin a family vacation?\nNo.\nI mean if it bites someone.\nMaybe, then yeah.\nMaybe?\nIt depends on the vacation, but yeah.\nCan a puppy make a baby smile?\nI mean, there's a lot of factors.\nJust...\nDepends on...\nThanks for helping is what I meant to say.\nSo the two votes against Reagan moving in must be Schmidt and Winston.\nThank God you had these magnets.\nYeah, well they're a backup housewarming gift for Schmidt and Cece in case my quilt guy screws me again.\nThank God you found this mysteriously sticky wall.\nLet's go get Schmidt and Winston and change their votes.\nI can't believe those two.\nYou stay here and wait.\nI can't. I'm going too crazy. I'm coming with you.\nNick, you're way too invested. Plus, it's tacky to whip your own votes.\nWe both know that never works with these guys.\nSchmidt, Winston... prepare to be buttonholed.\nDid you just say \"buttonholed\"?\nI mean whatever you got to do, Jess, but gross.\n[sighs] It's only one room, one flaw.\nEvery beautiful thing has one flaw. Marilyn Monroe has her beauty mark.\n\"Thriller\" has its Vincent Price poem.\nCece: Babe.\n[exhales]\nDo you like this ceiling fan?\nWicker... wicker blades!\nThey are made from reclaimed hampers.\nIt's like a dirty laundry propeller above our bed.\n[laughing]: Yes.\nOkay!\n[sighs] I love that we're on the same page.\nThat's right.\nTwo flaws. Okay. Two flaws.\nNo beautiful thing has two flaws, only ugly things. It's spreading.\n[gasps]\nThank you, Winston. Now I feel validated.\nNo, no, no, no. I just figured out why I know this house.\nYou see, it's in my favorite... school district.\nThat's nice.\nYeah.\nHey, Nick.\nSorry about the vote.\nI don't want to talk about it.\nCool. I need your help with a situation.\nThere is no situation you could possibly describe compelling enough to get me to want to help you.\nSchmidt and Cece's house was the location for the 1971 pornographic film, Daddy's Longleg.\nOkay, maybe there's one situation. I'm 100% in.\nThat piece is exquisite.\nNick: Oh!\nMay I see it from another angle?\n[chuckling]\nWoman: He was my best friend... until he became my enemy.\nWinston: The boar goes up, and the robe comes... down. That's p0rn.\nYou got this on a heavy rotation.\nSuper heavy rotation.\nPlease don't dance while we're watching p0rn videos together.\nOh, sorry about that. But I mean this is Schmidt and Cece's fireplace, right?\nIt looks like it, doesn't it?\nBut if it is... he can never know.\n[quietly]: Oh, come on... Nick.\nYou know that. He can never know.\nYes, but we're already keeping five secrets from him.\nThe secret vault is full.\nThat's not true. We only have four.\nWe have a slot open.\nYou always forget.\nLost umbrella.\nI forgot about lost umbrella.\nMm.\nI always forget about lost umbrella.\n[chuckling]: That's why it was lost.\nSo we're at maximum capacity. So what do we do?\nOkay, so pornographic house has to go into the vault.\nAgreed.\nSo what do we declassify?\nJalape\u00f1o 19?\nJalape\u00f1o 19? No way.\nUh... Duck, Duck, Gavin?\nOh, Duck, Duck, Gavin has to stay a secret.\nI would love to keep Upper Deck Timeshare between us and the guy we paid off.\nThere are no good options. Are you sure this is the house?\nI think so, but maybe not.\nOkay, so here's what we're gonna do. I'm going to watch with fresh eyes and I'm gonna see what my gut tells me, okay?\nYeah.\nYou go around the house, you take photos... for comparison.\nMm-hmm. Yes.\nWe'll look at all the pics, we'll come back here later, Mm-hmm.\nWe'll make a, you know, a final call.\nBoom.\n[chuckles]\nI need the phone for pictures.\nI need it to watch the p0rn.\nUse your phone.\nIt already started buffering.\nIt's two minutes in.\n[quietly]: It's buffering.\nTake mine... and take pictures with that.\nMakes sense. It's very smart, and that is why we are The Keepers of the Five Secrets.\nKeepers of the Five Secrets.\n[Chinese flute music playing]\nShh.\n[whispers]: Don't say a word.\n[groans]\n[sighs]\nGah!\nSecret ballots are never really secret. You know that, right?\nOkay fine. You got me.\nI voted nay.\nIt would just be six people for too long.\nWe would continue to be a married couple living with three roommates.\nYou want to make it four, increasing our humiliation by 33%.\nMr. Miller has no interest in seeing you humiliated.\nAnd as such, I've been empowered to offer you the following.\nI'm listening.\nAs a symbolic gesture, Reagan cannot list the loft as her official residence.\nWhere will her mail go?\nA P.O. Box.\nOh, yeah. All right, keep going.\nWhen asked where you live, you and Reagan will say the following.\n\"Geez, beats us. We're just dumb kids living paycheck to paycheck. Thank gosh for our upwardly mobile friends Schmidt and Cece, and the three guest rooms in their loft. We're crashing with them until we get our lives together and we remain there at their pleasure.\"\nDo I have to memorize all that?\nNo, you can just read it from the toilet paper.\n[sighs]\nAnd finally... you will allow Schmidt to buy you one pair of jeans.\nOh, he's serious.\n \n\n\n\nHey, Jess.\nDid Schmidt tell you I was gonna be in here?\nNo.\nThen how come you didn't get scared?\nBefore I enter any bathroom, I take a moment to myself and say, \"No matter what happens in there, don't get scared.\"\nAnd it works, you know, except for that one time when I was at the Cubs...\nOkay Jess, don't move.\nWhat's happening?\nDon't worry about it.\nHey, do me a favor.\nPut an arch in your back, just...\n[clicks]\nGot it. Okay.\nLet's take one together.\nOh, like a prom picture.\nYeah, kind of.\n[strains]: Here we...\n[clicking]\nGot it.\nI actually might need to retake that. I think my eyes were closed.\nBut first, let me see if any of this pork makes your tummy rumble.\nWinston would like you and Reagan to spend a mutually agreed upon amount of time as a couple with Ferguson.\nWe're talking about the cat?\nThe only couples that Ferguson knows are interracial.\nAnd while Winston views this as progress, he knows that it's not an accurate portrayal of... the world.\nYou even think that cat knows Winston exists?\nDefinitely not. Next, Winston would like to be the first person to see you in your new jeans.\nAnd he will see you under these circumstances, and these circumstances only: descending a grand spiral staircase, as Winston waits at the bottom, weeping with pride, holding your new belt.\nHe wants me to go upstairs without a belt.\nSome... We rent a really nice mansion.\nHey, you could do it, like, a museum...\nI'm not going to a public place and doing this with him.\nDo you want the yays or not?\nI need the yays.\nThe motion on the floor is the same, with some riders, most notably... the Furguson Bishop, White Immersion Program.\nUm, four yays, one nay?\nWho's this nay?\nI asked you what you wanted.\nAnd I voted yay.\nThat was about the vote?\nI thought y'all just wanted to get to know me better.\nI was already a yay.\nWell, that's everybody. Who's left?\nParikh, prepare to be buttonholed.\nI'm sorry I took your yay for granted.\nLet me wet your beak a little bit... you want sink time, you want fridge space, you want Schmidt and Winston to let you in on this whole jeans thing?\nNo, I don't want anything, okay.\nI voted nay because I'm trying to protect you.\nFrom who?\nFrom you, you lunatic.\nYou were being a good friend to Nick by letting Reagan move in, but I wouldn't be a good friend to you if I just let that happen.\nIf Nick wants Reagan to move in, then I want Reagan to move in.\nI mean, I don't want her to move in, but I... I support it.\nYou can support something without being the poster child for it, okay, so just maybe take a step back.\nI can't do that because my love for Nick exists, so it has to come out somewhere.\nIf you put water in Bugs Bunny's hole, it's gonna shoot out some other hole where Elmer Fudd least expects it.\nIs this other hole friendship?\nExactly. So I can't express my feelings for Nick through my romance hole, so I need to express them through my friendship hole.\nAnd I really regret hitching my wagon to \"hole.\"\nBut you... you get it, okay?\nI want you to know I'm gonna be fine, okay?\nYou promise?\nI promise.\nOkay, all right, I'll vote yay.\nIf Nick and Reagan aren't physical outside of their room.\nI'm sorry, but I have to protect you a little, okay, so just deal with it.\nThat's a really great rider, Cece.\nYou see, I think this is the tub where Daddy bathes the Soviet dissident.\nAnd this has to be the window seat where he spanks the Aztec twins.\nHey, side note, thank you for voting yay on the Reagan vote.\nI really want her to move in. I think I'm ready for this.\nShe will, and you are very much so ready.\nYeah. Yeah.\nSo many close-ups. It's so frustrating. I mean, for our purposes of today.\nYou know, mostly when they cut to wide I'm thinking why the hell are you showing me the room?\nBut now I want to see the room. I don't want to see the close-ups.\nWell, there's only one thing left.\n[phone chimes]\nSearch the locations manager for the 1971 adult film Daddy's Longleg.\nVery smart.\n[chimes] SEARCH VOICE: Searching now.\n[Chinese flute music playing]\nSecrets.\nSecrets.\nCece, this is the hardest thing that I've ever had to say to you.\nI had always assumed that when you got serious about interior design, I was going to love your ideas.\nBecause I love you.\nI hate your ideas. I hate them almost as much as I love you, which is so much.\nI have to stop you right there.\nI appreciate the fact that you are a very dramatic man, but the next time you start a conversation with, \"This is the hardest thing that I have ever had to say to you,\" it better end with, \"I'm gay now,\" \"I found a lump in my nut,\" or, \"He came out of nowhere, help me get the blood off of my car.\"\nI can't live in a house that you don't love.\nAnd I also can't live in a house of horrors!\nThank you for taking my note about being dramatic.\nNext time you don't like one of my suggestions, just tell me.\nI don't like your suggestions.\nOkay, well, then you suggest something, and then I suggest something, and eventually we reach a compromise.\nSo let's try it. Let's try it with the cabinets.\nI suggest a lighter wood, like birch.\nAbsolutely not.\nI mean... [clears throat]\nMm-hmm.\nI suggest a darker wood, like walnut.\nSo now we try to find something in the middle, like, how about oak?\nThat's fine, that's fine, I'm willing to go darker.\nCherry? Mahogany?\nWalnut?\nI love that suggestion!\nIt was your suggestion. It's not a compromise.\nOkay, fine, birch.\nNo!\nThat was my suggestion. That's still not a compromise.\nNow you're confusing me!\nJess [shouting]: Emergency off-site loft meeting!\nJess: Nick. Nick, it's time for the final vote. Where are you?\nThe motion now includes the Cece Parikh Hallway Decency Act.\nUgh! There's still one nay in here!\nOkay, I voted yay, I swear.\nThen who was it?\nWoman [on phone]: Roughstuff Productions.\nYou have a real guilty look on your face... a real nay face.\nThis is not my nay face. This is... this is how does a man compromise his vision face.\nMan [on phone]: Roughstuff Productions, this is Clem.\nUh, yeah, Clem, um. I'm calling about the whereabou...\n[grunting]\nWinston!\nClem: Sir, are you auditioning?\nAdmit it!\nWhy?\nOh... Aah...\nWhy?\nIt doesn't matter who voted nay.\nThe message is clear, somebody doesn't want Reagan in the loft.\nSo who cares who did it? Let's move on.\nWho is that person? I hate that person.\nAlso, maybe somebody realized moments before the vote that, if you think about it, my bed... it-it tilts west.\nAnd so she could roll off the bed in the middle of the night, and on the floor, and my floor tilts east...\nNick.\nWhich means she could roll under my bed and be lost forever.\nDid you vote nay?\nYeah, of course I did.\nI don't know what I want. I'm confused.\nOoh-whee! Politics!\nSchmidt, you need to take these design blinders off and look around.\nWe compromise all the time.\nWe named our house Jaipur Aviv.\nThat's right.\nI wanted to call it Ghatak/Mossad HQ, and you wanted to call it...\nOur House.\nOur House, yes.\nWe met in the middle and we called it Jaipur Aviv.\nYou know what, every compromise doesn't have to be 50-50.\nI've been looking at cabinets online.\nThey all look exactly the same to me.\nNo, they don't.\nThey really do.\nBirch, walnut, mahogany, fiberglass, stainless steel.\nYou can't tell the difference between metal and wood?\nNot when it comes to a cabinet.\nI just see cabinet, and then I go, like, \"Oh, my plate's in there.\"\nI think this is a bigger issue than interior design.\nI think it just applies to cabinets.\nAnd I accept the fact that I am not good at interior design, and you're brilliant at it.\nSo you should take the lead on that.\nJust like I'm no good at cooking Indian food.\nMm.\nYou take the lead on that.\nYou always let me make dessert.\nI always burn it.\nI just want you to feel included.\nEven if it's in just some small, symbolic way.\n[doorbell plays \"La Cucaracha\"]\n[melody repeats]\n[melody repeats]\nOkay.\nHey.\nDo you know how anything works?\nI know you whipped and you buttonholed and you swing-setted your tail off to get all these votes.\nWho did I swing-set?\nOnce I got the votes, I panicked.\nBecause I realized that now I have to ask her, and what if she says no?\nOr worse, what if she says yes, moves in with me, and then regrets it?\nI wish we'd had this conversation at the beginning of the day, but yeah, I mean, I get it, it's scary.\nWell, tell me I'm wrong to be scared.\nYou know, tell me I should vote yay.\nNick, I whipped everyone's votes.\nI'm not gonna whip yours.\nBut whatever you decide, I support you.\nWe all do.\nIf I vote yay, all that means is is that I can ask her.\nEmphasis on \"can.\"\nAnd that I don't have to. Emphasis on \"have.\"\nWow. Well, no one loves parsing more than I do, and even I find this tedious, but... yes.\nAll right, slide me over.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nWhoa, is this wall just sticky, or is it... magnetic?\nWe have got to get a magnetic wall.\nWe will never buy another coil of wires connected to a battery again in our lives.\nIt'll pay for itself in a week. [scoffs]\n[Daddy's Longleg playing over phone]\nOkay, Roughstuff Productions referred me to their former subsidiary Tick Tock Erotica, LLC, which split from Roughstuff back in '09.\nBut here's the thing. Tick Tock is in the app space now, but they still use the same headhunter.\nAnd they still had the number for a Mr. Mort Capaco, locations manager, Daddy's Longleg.\nDid he know where they shot it?\nHe did not.\nAll right, we've got to give up a secret.\nThe only question is who breaks the news.\nI'll break the news if I get to pick the secret.\nDeal. But I really recommend that you tell him about Halloween 2004.\nHalloween 2004.\nThat's what I was gonna say.\n[Chinese flute music playing]\nSecrets exchanged.\nSecrets exchanged.\nShh.\nWoman [over phone]: I could never say no to the man that saved my sled dogs.\n[p0rn music playing]\nSchmidt, I need to tell you something unpleasant about some candy you ate.\n[door opens, closes]\nWhat?\nMany years...\nIt was shot in Seattle.\nDaddy's Longleg was shot in Seattle.\nWhat's Daddy's Longleg?\nA pornographic movie Winston and I really like.\nYou don't have to worry about it.\nBecause... it was... not filmed in your home.\nSo congratulations!\nWow, we did it, honey.\nWas that in question?\nHey, did you ask Reagan?\nI've decided to ask her, but I haven't asked her yet.\nI don't know how to.\nAll I've got right now is, \"Hey, Nickname\"... that's what we're calling each other until we can think of something better.\nUh... and after that, I'm a little stumped.\nWell, why do you want Reagan to move in?\nBecause I want to spend a lot of time with her, and if she moves in, I'll be able to spend more time with her.\nWell, if she moved in, how would that make you feel, Nick?\nI'd feel honored.\nHonored or happy?\nBoth.\nAnd what's your name?\nMy name is Nick.\nProbably could've got that on my own.\nNoted.\nWow.\nI mean, that's perfect. And it's already on my phone.\nBut there's just some things I want to agonize over out loud with you guys.\nAnd send.\nI wanted to agonize, I said I needed to agonize I've to tell you. That was great.\nGod bless you.\nYou're welcome everyone.\nAbout this p0rn you watched together...\n"}, {"title": "06x06 - Ready.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n[softly]: I'm ready.\nI'm ready!\nCece, good news.\nI'm making you bar manager!\nYeah, I finally want to focus on my writing.\nAnd you can implement all the ideas that you've been suggesting.\nAll I said was that the ladies' bathroom needs more toilet paper.\nAnd I want you to implement that... as manager.\nAll right.\nCece, this could be your whole future. What do you say?\n\"Whole future\" makes it seem like I'm gonna grow old and die there, which is terrifying.\nOh, yeah, but... yeah...\nI mean, I could use the money...\nSee, that's what I'm saying!

This is my bar.

He's actually an aspiring model and I figure he'll bring in more women.\nHow would he bring in more women?\nBecause he is super hot.\nThat guy is super hot?\nYes.\nOkay, if you say so.\nI don't say so.\nThe Lord says so. That boy is off the charts.\nI wouldn't know.\nOkay, don't be that guy.\nI'm not being that guy. I don't see it.\nDon't be the, \"Eh, I wouldn't know\" guy.\nIt's a bad color on you.\nNo, I'm not saying it's a color.\nI'm not even making... like... I don't see that he's more handsome.\nI have been getting all kinds of female attention lately.\nDid I suddenly get more attractive?\nHow should I know?! I don't see that kind of thing.\nI'm just trying to write.\nBabe.\nYeah, babe.\nBabe.\nYes, babe?\nYou have a girlfriend now, which means you've got a lot of confidence and women love that.\nNow, if you'll just keep making it clear that you have a girlfriend, it'll pass.\nI hate shutting women down all damn night.\nI want to be a source of light in the world.\nWell...\nThat's why I always sit at the table with the little kids first.\n[both laughing]\nMan, that restaurant was so weird.\nI feel like we were the only people not celebrating a birthday.\nWell, it-it was called Birthdays.\n Birthday, birthday, birthday \nHow's the chicken?\nSorry, what?\n[people singing loudly]\nHow-how's your chicken?\nWhat?\nI was just saying, \"How is your chicken?\"\nOh, yeah. I have chicken.\nYes. Yeah.\nI-I know you have it, but how...\nI ordered the chicken.\nWhat?\nI ordered the chicken!\nRight, right, right. Is it good, though?\nIt was a loud, horrible restaurant.

Uh...\nJess, why are you not dressed for the gymnasia?\nHmm. I'm not going.\nWhy the hell not?\nOh, is it your birthday?\nNo. I just...\nDid we forget your birthday? This is terrible.\nIt's not my birthday.\nIt's a big one, too, isn't it?\nHow old do you think I...\nNo, I'm eating leftovers from my date with Robby.\nDid you go to Birthdays?\nYou know, if you get a chance, you should try the Birthdays Express at the airport.\nI like it better. It's del...\nAnyway, how was your date?\nIt was great and then it was disastrous.\nOh, so you had sex with him?\nNo.\nThe opposite.\nThe opposite?\nSo, you gave birth to him?\nNo. It was going really well.\nIt was fun and then at the end, he clearly wanted to kiss and I thought I did, too, and then... instead I just gave him the old Pittsburgh good-bye.\nChuck on the arm and a handshake?\nWhy would you do that?\nBecause, I...\n[sighs]\nIn that moment, I just couldn't see myself spending the rest of my life with him.\n80 years old, feeding him pea soup out of a tin cup.\nI'm confused. Is this a happy ending for Jess Day?\nI mean, where are you living at this point, under a bridge?\nI see you and Cece and Nick and Reagan and Winston and Furguson...\nAly.\nSorry, that just came out. Winston and Aly.\nAnd you're all in love, and I just... don't know if I'll ever have that magic with Robby.\nSee, this just proves my theory that if you were a man, you would have a very difficult time getting an erection.\nYou have a theory about that?\nYou're putting way too much pressure on yourself.\nIt's a date, it's not the rest of your life.\nYou had a good time, right?\nWell, yeah, it was Robby.\nHe's the funniest guy in the world.\nSo lighten up. If you want to kiss him, kiss him.\nWho knows... maybe you'll see if you have magic then.\nYou know what? You're right.\nI was gonna try to avoid Robby, but funk that chicken!\nI'm gonna go get my gym clothes on!\nYeah.\nI'm gonna put my push-up bra on.\nThat's actually not a bra that pushes my breasts up, it's actually one that I do push-ups in.\nI get it.\nSmash these babies down.\nLet's do it.\nOoh, no, Cece, you know it's not Jess' birthday, right?\nPut that away.\nYeah, no, I know that.\nUm, this gift is for you.\nWhat?\nMm-hmm.\nCece... It's a scarf.\nYeah. [chuckles]\nI love it.\nAlmost makes me want to go to Buffalo for work.\nThank you.\nMm-hmm.\nLook at... look at that.\nOh, no.\nO-oh, no. Oh, no!\nHow long does she think my freakin' neck is?\nIt's a fat-man scarf.\nMy wife gave me a fat-man scarf!\nI did a few freelance modeling gigs.\nI was the \"wowee face\" for an amusement park ad.\n[chuckles]: That's actually really great.\nOh, that was you.\nWe really gotta get you working.\nLet me take a few photos to send to a photographer I used to work with.\nDo some model looks.\nAll right.\nUm, this one I call, \"I just saw something patriotic.\"\nAll right...\nIt was an eagle.\nI was gonna say eagle.\nI want to show some range.\nShow me \"I just saw something unpatriotic.\"\nHow you gonna pull that off?\nOh.\nThat's some rich gravy, man.\nI noticed you from across the way.\nCan I buy you a drink?\nI'm sorry, but let me be very clear.\nI have a girlfriend., and I am very much so devoted to her.\nAw.\nHere's my number. Use it.\nShe didn't listen to a word...\nThrow a peanut out of frustration!\nOkay, why are you even here?\nI thought the whole point of promoting me was you could go off and write.\nI would love to be writing, but thanks to you, all I can do is look at Donovan's face and try to figure out why humans find it appealing.\nThis is insane... you have to be able to admit that he's attractive.\nI do... How would I know?\nNick, please, that dude is hot as hell, man.\nHe is a member of the Hall of Fine.\nHe's more attractive than Joe Mangaroni.\nManga... Joe Menden...\nWho are you thinking of?\nMagic Mike's friend.\nOh, he's married to that...\nYeah, J Lo.\nJoe Mangallini.\nJoe Mangallini.\nHe's more attractive than Joe Mangallini.\nOkay, I know for a fact... that this was the most attractive man in America for ten years.\nI know that because magazines told me so.\nBut...\nOkay...\n\n\n\nHey, Donovan, could you copy that?\nYou guys don't look anything alike.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nAre you planning on speeding up at any point?\nOh, my God, Schmidt, are you walking on a decline?\nThis is what we call a \"trudge,\" Jess.\nMy wife has given up on me, why shouldn't I?\n[imitating police siren]\nUh, license and registration, please.\n[laughing]\nI had a great time last night, you know?\nAnd thank you for taking that cake off my hands.\nI would have eaten it for breakfast.\nHuh, gross, right?\n[chuckles]\nBetter get back to my uppers.\nBy the time this knee is fixed, I'm gonna look like the WB frog, you know?\n[imitating WB frog]:  Ba da bup a duh breeer. \n[laughs]\n[chuckling]\nThat guy...\nYou're the only two people in here that enjoyed that.\nPlease go after him.\nHey, need a spot?\nYeah, yeah, that'd be great, thanks.\nHey, Jess, about last night, at the end there, I hope I wasn't...\nNo, you weren't, and I hope you didn't think that...\nI just kinda thought that we were in synch, you know?\nBut then...\nNo, Robby...\nI wanted to kiss you, too.\nYou did?\nOh...\nOh, well, Jess, I don't know if this is...\nOh, okay.\n[both crying out]\n[alarmed chatter]\nSomebody call an ambulance.\nRobby, are you okay?\nI don't know, Robby hurt his mouth pretty bad here.\nIt hurts a lot. It felt good first, but then it hurts a lot now.\nJess: Just so you know, this is all your fault.\nOh, that's fair.\nI should have made it very clear to you not to kiss Robby while he was balancing a dangerous amount of weight above his head.\nThere was a moment before the bar came down where we were just two people kissing, and... nothing.\nNo magic.\nLook, at least now you know.\nNo harm done, right?\nA tremendous amount of harm done.\nNow I have to tell a man I maimed that I'm not interested.\nOn the bright side, you're not that hurt.\nCome to think of it, how are you not more hurt?\nWhen I was in triage, they said that my neck muscles had served as kind of a neck helmet, which made me feel like I was not talking to real doctors.\nAnyway, I just have to wear this thing for the next few days just as a precaution.\nWell, if you want to cover it up, Cece gave me a scarf that's perfect.\nIt's long enough to wrap around an above-ground pool filled with Alfredo sauce.\nAlfredo sauce. Doesn't that sound good?\nNot really.\nI don't know.\nMaybe Cece's right.\nMaybe I am turning into a fat man.\nCece never called you fat.\nWell, I am.\nI'm a fat man married to a hot woman.\nCool, I'm a sitcom.\nThat sounds like a great show.\nThrow in a wacky neighbor, I'm watching.\nMaybe the reason why you don't want to go to the gym is 'cause you want to hang out with your beautiful wife.\nRight?\nAnd you're fat and happy because you're happy.\nYou're right.\nI'm a lucky man.\nA Lucky Man should be the name of your show.\nYou're a beleaguered casino owner, and a father of three.\nMan: Ms. Day?\nYes?\nMr. McFerrin's regained consciousness.\nOh, thank goodness.\nYou can see him now.\nThank you. All right.\nYou should go home, this could be a long conversation.\nWoman's voice: Two-four-seven-seven, satellite pharmacy...\nWait a minute.\nRobby's full name is Robby McFerrin?\nHow did I not put this together?\nHey.\nHey.\nI met with that photographer you sent me to. It went great.\nI mean, he even gave me a free bottle of water.\nOoh.\nI felt like a movie star.\n[chuckles]\nHe wants to work together.\nThat's amazing.\nI got these release forms to sign.\nYou want me to take a look at them for you?\nYeah.\nOkay. There we go. [clears throat]\nDonovan, these terms are unacceptable.\nHe's really screwing you.\nAww...\nYou know what?\nI'm gonna get on the phone with him, because if we start treating our attractive people like this, our society is gonna collapse.\n[sighs] Hey, man, you busy writing?\nWhat does it look like?\nWant a rain-stick?\nSome girl gave it to me.\nYou know, I'm getting a lot of gifts from women who want to sleep with me lately.\nYou know? It's hopeless, man.\nI'm so damn confident.\nWinston, I was really hoping to make headway on this, but uh, we got to put out this fire, don't we?\nIt's hot.\nHmm.\nYou're too confident.\nToo confident ain't the word.\nI'm at a whole new level.\nDo you remember when you were taking the bus to the farmer's market and it hit a bump and you soiled yourself?\nThat was not my favorite Arbor Day. [laughs]\nWhy you, uh... why are you bringing that up?\nRemember when you, uh, were in the park, and a bee flew into your mouth and then you fell off the bridge at that place where all the ducks go to the bathroom?\nI see what you're doing. Keep it going.\nRemember when you had to leave Latvia because you weren't good enough to be a professional basketball player, and you came back home to be a full time babysitter?\nOkay. All right. Time out.\nYou know, you, you hit a nerve.\nOkay.\nDefinitely brought me down a peg.\nI'm sorry.\nIt's okay. I needed it.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nI feel some less confident now.\nMy man. [laughs]\n[laughing]: All right, then.\nAll right. Back to my novel.\n[upbeat song playing on radio]\nYou're still on that?\nI can't figure it out.\nLook. Imagine a world where you woke up one morning and instead of your face, you had Donovan's face.\nWhoa.\nAnd instead of your body, you had his.\nHow would you feel?\nIf I had his face and his body?\nOh-hoo, yeah.\nI'd feel fantastic.\nAnd that's... how you know he's attractive.\nHmm.\nHmm.\nCan I have a minute with this, please?\nOh, sure thing.\nCan I interest you in some white noise?\nYes, please.\n[shakes rain-stick contents]\n[contents falling like rain]\nHmm.\n[contents falling]\nSo, when a man looks like a man that you wouldn't mind looking like, that's a way to assess a man's attractiveness.\nExactly.\nOh!\nCece: That's right.\nYou are gonna draw up a brand new agreement for Donovan to sign.\nHell, yeah, you're gonna have a courier bring it over to me right now.\nAnd, uh, listen closely, Marco, Donovan subsection H is a deal breaker, so, rip it out of the agreement and burn it.\nOr we're walking.\nLook forward to hearing from you. Thanks, bye.\nThat was amazing.\nYeah.\nThat was amazing.\n \nWoman's voice: Allen to pulmonary medicine. Dr. Allen to...\nHey, Robby.\nHi, Jess.\nOh!\n[inhales sharply]\nYou don't look so bad. [chuckles]\nMm-hmm...\nOh, don't smile. Don't smile.\nYou make me want to smile.\nDon't! You'll pop a stitch.\nDon't smile. I'm so sorry.\nNo, don't be.\nIt was worth it, Jess, because what happened between us was so magical.\nA dark magic, maybe.\nCan I make a confession?\nI wish you wouldn't.\nWhen I was under...\nHere we go.\nI saw a bright light.\nAnd I felt that I had the choice to either go into the light or to come back to you.\nAnd well, here we are.\nMm... this is gonna be a tough one.\nYou know what's so great?\nNo. I don't.\nOur first kiss is gonna be such a good story to tell.\nIt's not that good of a story.\nPretty good story.\nRobby, I have something to tell you.\nI...\nMm-hmm?\n[crunches]\n[screams]\nOh, my God! Your bad knee! Oh, my God!\nI'll get someone to help.\n[groaning]\nAah... Oh!\n[mouth full]: Mm. There she is.\nJess. Big news.\nI realized that you were right.\nI'm happy because Cece loves me and she's gonna love me no matter what, even if I turn into a bloated Ashkenazi marshmallow.\nTurns out, I don't have to work out ever again.\nI can eat as much as I want and still be happy.\nOoh. How'd your thing go?\nBreak the news to Robby?\nNo.\nBefore I could break his heart, I shattered his leg.\nIt's now in two pieces, connected by... a skin tunnel where his knee should be.\nHmm.\nSo, you've broken him twice now.\n[sighs] How am I supposed to tell him I'm not interested now?\nI don't think you have any other choice.\nI mean, what are you gonna do?\nYou're just gonna pretend to be into him and then... nurse him for the rest of your life?\n \nOkay, Robby, time for your soup.\n[grunts]\nGood morning.\nIn a strange way, I find this to be deeply romantic.\nYes. It's very romantic, waiting for his body to heal before I destroy his soul.\nCling, clung, I got a robot dong.\nI got a robot dong goes cling, cling, cling...\nYou got to love Robby.\nHe's been singing that a lot.\nCece.\nHmm?\nYou've done a great job, but I'm gonna have to demote you.\nHuh?\nShouldn't be a manager, because you should be a manager.\nAre you just saying words in no particular order?\nWe asked Donovan to bring in a couple of his \"hottest friends.\"\n[chuckles] And he sure did.\nAnd I know that because I wouldn't mind having their faces.\nAnd I wouldn't mind having their bodies.\nOkay.\nWinston: We saw you on the phone with that photographer, and you have a gift.\nYou shouldn't be managing a bar.\nYou should be managing people like Donovan.\nBeautiful idiots?\nNo offense.\nOh. [scoffs]\nAnd these objectively handsome men.\nThey're models, too. Just like me.\nMe, managing models?\nJust like him and him and him.\nYeah. They're all models just like him.\nWell, I do know the business.\nAnd I hate working here.\nEasy.\nI mean, I'm gonna keep working here. I need the cash.\nSchmidt is eating us out of house and home.\nSchmidt: Barkeep! Mudslide, extra whip.\nComing right up, babe.\nYou know what?\nAll right.\nI think that I'll do it.\nHa, ha!\nOkay, guys. Let's see what you're working with.\nI actually just meant show me a portfolio but... that'll do.\n[sighing]: Where's my mudslide?\nWho are these?\nMy new... clients.\nHoney, I think I'm gonna start managing models.\nAre you rea... that's a... that's amazing.\nCongratulations, Cece. I think you'd be really great at that.\nI'm proud of you.\nYeah?\nSo, you'll just be swimming in beefcakes all day and then you'll just... be coming home to this sock full of meatloaf. [laughs]\nUh-huh, sister. Not gonna happen.\nI'm going back to the gym.\nDon't need this fat man scarf.\nWant help? You got it?\nYou didn't like my gift?\nIt just goes on forever.\nWinston: You literally just got to take it off.\nWhy'd you do that?\nJess: Hey! What am I missing?\nCece's gonna manage models.\nI can't hear anything from over here. I'm gonna come over.\nYou guys are really good looking.\nThank you, man.\nNot you. These three.\nOh.\nDon't celebrate without me.\n[grunts]\nWinston: Oh!\nOh, sorry! Oh. Sorry.\nYou got to...\nOh!\n[grunting] Okay...\nJust move your foot a little bit...\nAah, you just...\nI can't get it out.\nOkay, one of us should help.\nI know, we should help.\nCan you just lift your foot a little bit...\nNick: That way, that way.\nYou're hurting him. Go like this.\nOh! Sorry!\nGo like this!\nGo like... No. That's not helping.\nOh, aah! Sorry.\n"}, {"title": "06x07 - Last Thanksgiving.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWelcome to the ceremonial lighting of the first burner.\nCome on, Susan!\nThere it is!\n[Cece gasps]\nAah!\nThanksgiving!\nIt is 7:00 A.M.\nI've actually been up for two hours.\nLet's do this! Perfect Thanksgiving!\nReagan's coming today, and I want everything to be great for the guest of honor.\nOh, the... the guest of honor?\nYeah, the guest of honor.\nI guess my dad spending Thanksgiving with me for the first time ever is a non-event.\nOoh. Is he bringing his new squoosh?\nHmm?\nIs that a thing people say?\nNo.\nUh-uh.\nWell, his squoosh has a name, and it's Ann Kim.\nShe's probably gonna want to spend some time with you ladies, too, because you know how fathers and sons can be on Thanksgiving.\nDrinking beer, watching the game, hugging each other in a way that suggests, \"I forgive you for every... for everything.\"\nOkay, look, I know you're excited, but maybe don't put so much pressure on it, you know?\nI mean, we all... we all know who your dad is.\nWho he was. Who he was, though.\nJust don't expect too much.\nJust be happy that he's coming at all.\nSo what time's Robby coming?\nHe's not coming.\nHe is going to visit his folks.\nWhat's your guys' deal now?\nAre you actually together, or are you just nursing him back to health 'cause you broke his entire body and face?\nWe are not together, but I don't think Robby understands that.\nI wonder why, Jess.\nYou only hang out with him 24/7.\n Come on, baby, make it hurt so... \n[screaming]\nI feel mean telling him we're not dating when he's in this state.\nCece: It is a lot meaner to lead him on, okay?\nYou got to drop the hammer.\nI know. You're right.\nI'll do it next time I see him. I'm just dreading it.\nHe's such a good egg.\nI mean, with his dad khakis and his glasses and his... his... his sweet little change purse.\nYou know what? That's it.

I was at work, though.\nRunning for a bagel.\nLook, Robby's the only one who understands my pain.\nWell, nothing makes me happier than cooking for ten hours and eating in under 25 minutes.

Is it Rick Snip?\nDid you drop the hammer?\nI have not dropped the hammer.\nSnoopy! Saw Snoopy.\nOkay, no. You-you got to end this.\nRobby: False alarm. It's just John Stamos on a Greek yogurt float.\nDrop the hammer now?\nHe can't even tell the difference between John Stamos and Snoopy.\nYou can't break a man's heart on a holiday.\nI'm telling you, it happened to me once, and that pain... it comes back year after year after year.\nYou don't want to do that to him, I'm telling you.\nThat's why I'm always a hot mess on take-your-daughter-to-work day.\nRobby: Uh-oh. It's the senior citizens choir.\nGet the tissues!\nWinston: Look, I'll tell you what, Jess.\nI'll keep him busy for the day.\nYou can destroy him tomorrow.\nThank you, Winston.\nYou know what?

Little boy blues?\nYeah, I've been there.\nHow many miggies you working with?\nYeah, my pharmacist bumped me up to nine.\n1,400. Yeah. I have to take 18 pills an hour in a very specific order, and they virtually assured me that I will be addicted to them.\nHey.\nHey.\nHey, what happened to Rick Snip?\nUh, gone and, uh... [sniffles, sighs] these tears... honestly, they're from the onions.\nThey're not from Reagan bailing.\nOh, no. Reagan's not coming?\nNo. She just called. Uh, her boss sent her to Omaha, so she can't make it, but it's fine.\nOh, I'm sorry, Nick.\nI also wear a slow-release opium patch on my spine.\n[laughs]\nHey, I ever told you the story of how I got injured in the first place?\nYes.\nOne may think that it started because of a lack of bagels, but no.\nIt started with a surplus... of cream cheese.\nOf cream cheese.\nYes, yes, you're familiar with such happening.\nYou know what? I think Jess told me to help her...\nNo, no, no, no. You're good.\nUh, lock you up. [laughs]\nI'm sure she's bummed, too.\nHow long is she gonna be there?\nNo idea. I didn't ask.\nI just said, \"Happy Thanksgiving.\"\n[sizzling]\n[whooshing]\nAnd then I hung up.\nOkay, you're gonna have to leave the kitchen.\nThe whole sad-guy, whiskey-flame combination is starting to worry me.\nLet me know when my whiskey boils down to a crystal so I can eat it.\nHey, Dad, are you okay in there?\nDid you fall in?\nThat's a dad joke that I would've assumed I would have heard you make had you been around more.\nGavin: I want you to know I'm not using the bathroom.\nI'm just sitting here.\nHey, Dad, you know what's a great cure for heartache?\nA little father-and-son time.\nYou know, we could have a catch, whittle a stick.\nWhy don't you just come out?\n[door squeaks open]\nI'm sorry, son.

No. I'm-I'm fine.\nLook, we don't wear sweaters and roll around in the leaves, but there are other ways for us to bond.\nIf he wants to drink, then, you know what? I'm gonna drink.\nI'm gonna get sloppy with my poppy.\nNick. Papa! Wait for me.\nJust need to get my bitters kit.\nOoh, actually, can you just make sure that there's a garbage can next to the bed?\nBecause... I can't hang.\n[television playing nearby]\nRobby!\nWhat are you doing here with me and not with Winston?\nI like Winston, but he's been telling this bagel story for ten minutes.\nI haven't even met all the main characters yet.\nPlus, I have a little surprise for you.\nTo make up for this morning, the airline gave me two free tickets to anywhere in the contiguous 48 states.\nOh. Ha.\nWell, I'd love to, you know, plan our future, but we're eating in under four hours, and so I have to put you to work.\nOkay, you just, crouton.\nOh.\nAll right. Keep croutonning.\nOkay, I'm not that close to the table.\n[clank] Darn it.\nI was just in the bathroom...\nRobby: Nothing but net. with my husband and his father.\nAre you also having a good Thanksgiving?\nHey, Jess. Check this out.\nDid that go in?\nRobby got plane tickets, Swish. and he wants to whisk my away, Nothing but bowl. once he gets better, which could be months from now.\nJess, I'm looking up some hotels right now.\nTwin bed's okay, right?\nHammer time?\nHammer time.\nCheers.\nYes, sir.\nAh. This is the dream.\nA boy, his dad, his best friend sharing a drink.\nDon't tell Mom, right?\n[laughing]: I'm just kidding.\nI know you and Mom haven't spoken in 30 years, including my wedding.\nYou know what's stupid?\nThere's a part of me that actually thought I might have a wedding with Ann Kim someday.\nI don't think that's stupid at all, Dad.\nI think that's beautiful.\nYou know, you opened up your heart to Ann Kim and that's brave.\nMaybe she was just scared.\nYou know women. They're a mystery.\nYeah, sometimes they just go to Omaha and you don't know when they're gonna come back.\nOr if they're coming back.\nHow do you even know she's in Omaha?\nOh, because, uh, she said she was.\nNothing means anything.\nNothing means anything.\nNothing... means anything.\nAt least you're young, Nick.\nYou got a rocking bod with kickass buns.\nYou're not gonna have any problems.\nWho's gonna want an old guy like me?\nI've got garbage buns.\nWhat? Are you out of your mind? Dad, you've got fantastic buns.\nYou think?\nI'm telling you, you've got nothing to worry about.\nNick, stand up, put your buns next to each other, so... here.\nWhat is happening here?\nI'm not doing anybody any favors today.\nI'm a bummer.\nProbably the best thing I could do would be to head home.\nSee you later, man, nice to see you again.\nDad, stay. Look... you're gonna land on your feet.\nI've see... I've seen all kinds of women throw themselves at you.\nLifeguards and teachers, lens crafters.\nRemember when you had your tongue in Jess' mouth?\nShe tasted like licorice... sweet but with a bite.\nNot... you're not helping, Nick.\nActually, you know what? Can I see you in the hallway, please?\nWhy?\n[groans]\n\n\n\nNick, we have got to go to Ann Kim's house and convince her to give my dad a second chance.\nIt's the only way he's gonna stay.\nShe's not gonna come. She's a snake.\nAll women are snakes.\nI understand that you're spinning out about Reagan.\nI'm spinning out about Reagan.\nI get it. But you have to help me save my Thanksgiving with my dad.\nYou're right. I'm so sorry.\nWe can pull this off.\nIf we get her to take him back...\n... We'd be heroes.\nThat's right.\n[both laughing]\nLook at that, Mom, I'm gonna be a hero.\nWhy are you looking up? Your mother is still alive.\nI'm looking at Chicago.\nYou think Chicago is up?\nIt's north.\nRobby, you're a great guy, but nothing is ever gonna happen between us.\nHowever, someday you're gonna open a really wonderful bed and breakfast.\nThat was pretty good.\nI mean, right?\nCan you imagine the wine and cheese hour he would put on?\nStuff the toga with hot coals.\nWe're going out.\nWhat? Wait.\nHave a place setting at the table for Ann Kim, but don't seat her next to my dad.\nI want all the couples split up.\nEverybody gets to talk that way, but, uh... and then put me next to Nick.\nYeah.\nAnd then my dad next to me as well.\nSo I'm sandwiched between Nick and my dad.\nYou guys can't leave. We need you here.\nWell, I need a happy daddy.\nHe needs a happy daddy.\nIf they never come back, the last words I'll have heard my husband say are \"happy daddy.\"\nOkay, good luck.\nOh, smells great.\nThat's just my famous gravy. [chuckles]\nThe trick is, um, a pinch of brown sugar and then a couple more handfuls of brown sugar.\nActually, uh, just a lot of brown sugar.\nAnn Kim loves gravy.\nBig dogs, small horses, the smell of rain, and gasoline.\n[sobbing]\nOh, Gavin.\nYou're a handsome and passionate and charismatic man.\nYou and me.\nWe really had something.\nWhat do you say we give it another shot?\nLet's just drive and drive and drive.\nI know what I'm not thankful for this year.\nThis. This is it.\nRobby, this is not what it looks...\nDon't say anything.\nI-I don't even know where to begin, so I'll just start by saying that is smells delicious in here.\nI'm gonna leave.\n[groans]\nJust... hold on a second.\n[clattering]\n[groans]\nHey, Ann Kim, show your face.\nYou cold-hearted zombie.\nWho's down there?\nIt's Gavin's son.\nI don't know if you remember this, but we went on a double date once.\nMy wife got terribly ill from some truffle oil.\nRich foods don't agree with her.\nDid Gavin send you?\nNo, no, no. He doesn't even know that I'm here.\nLook, Ann Kim, he's heartbroken.\nYou opened up something inside of him, and you turned him into the man that I always knew that he could be.\nAnd darn it, I'm just a kid... [sighs] hoping for a Thanksgiving miracle.\nWhy don't you give him a second chance and come back with us, and let's all give thanks together.\nGreat speech.\nYeah, it really was a great speech, man.\nThanks.\nDid you do it with the five other women he's dating?\nWhat?\nThat's why he always refers to me by my first and last name, because he's dating two Anns.\nThis is worse than my Reagan thing.\nI can't believe that I spent all day feeling sorry for that son of a bitch.\nI guess I'm the son of a bitch.\nLeave or I'm hitting the sprinklers.\nAnn Kim, please, give me a minute to process this.\nSprinklers!\nThat was not a minute!\nSprinklers!\nThat was not a minute!\nNo!\n[knocking on door]\nHello, Jessica.\nIf you're here to hurt Robby, then you're here to hurt me.\nAnd if you hurt me, then I'm gonna hurt Robby.\nWait a minute. No. If you're here...\nIf you don't get out of your room, I'm gonna bleach all your bird shirts.\nRobby, I got to go.\nThat's a wise choice.\n[sighs]\nRobby, I need you to know that there is...\n[exhales] nothing going on between me and Gavin, except for an icy awkwardness that will continue until one or both of us is dead.\nOh, thank God. [laughs]\nI mean, I was sitting here thinking, really? Schmidt's dad.\nI know. That'd be crazy, right?\nAlthough I totally get it.\nI mean... [exhales] he's got that rakish charm.\nAnd that voice. Oh, my God.\nGreat buns and...\nRobby, stop. There's more.\nOh, boy.\nI think I know where this is going.\nLet me guess.\nYou see me as more of a friend.\nWell, I didn't want to talk about it on Thanksgiving.\nBut you brought the tickets and...\nJess, it's okay. I get it.\nYou know, there has to be that, um...\nOomph?\nYeah. I was gonna say \"yowza,\" but, uh, oomph. You can't force the oomph, you know?\nI'll take my mom to Phoenix. She's nuts about Phoenix.\nSchmidt: Well, congrats, Dad!\nHoliday's over! You ruined another Thanksgiving!\nI can't believe that you're seeing six women.\nWhat's going on?\nHow do you run a vineyard?\nNot well. I'm seeing six women.\nHe tried to make it seven.\nI caught him making a move on Jess.\nAgain? Why is my father so sexual?\nWhy is he asking Chicago?\nGood question.\nYou know what, Gavin, if this is who you really are, then you can forget about Thanksgiving and all the holidays and all the non-holidays.\nPretty much what I'm talking about is every day.\nHey, hey, hey, guys, let's remember the reason for the season.\nWe're all very thankful.\nGavin: Jess, I am so sorry.\nI had no idea you two were together.\nI thought you were his physical therapist.\nPhysical therapist?\nAren't you a physical therapist or something?\nYou think she's a... Jess is a top-notch vice principal.\n[grunts]\nJess: Oh, Robby...\nRobby, no. Don't stand.\nYour-your knee.\nI don't give a flying care about that.\nI stand up when I stand up for people.\nI think you're getting roid rage.\nI didn't take any steroids today, because the TSA took 'em this morning.\nNow, what you're seeing is pure, unfiltered Robby, straight from the tap.\nGet him, Robby.\nYou-you tried to make Jess the seventh woman you're dating, and you don't even know the first thing about her.\nI mean, did-did you know that when she was six she tried to eat a lightning bug so that her heart would glow like E.T.?\nDid you know that she tried to give herself Lyme disease out of solidarity to her fourth grade classmate?\nOr-or that she never lets any of her electronics go below 25%, just in case someone else needs to use them?\nI mean, did you know... did you know that she's terrified of the large bubbles in the bubble wrap but she loves the little tiny ones?\nIt's so cute, man.\nIt would be one thing if you actually had feelings for Jess...\nI'm... I'm...\nOh!\nWhoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.\nOh.\nThank you. But you don't.\nY-you're just desperate and lonely and you're trying to use her, and I...\nOh, it's happening again.\nOh.\nWhoa, whoa, whoa!\nOh, oh.\nThank you.\nYou can't use Jess, because she is a dream girl.\nHere's the last thing I'll say before I leave.\nJess, I know it's not me, but... [sighs] you deserve somebody who knows how special you are.\nUm, I'm going. I'm going.\nDon't go, Robby.\nI'm not going out. I'm-I'm going down!\n[gasping, shouting]\nRobby, no!\nTurkey! Turkey's down!\nRobby! Robby!\nTurkey's down!\nSchmidt: Oh, God!\nRelax!\n[grunting]\nCece: Just...\nOkay. It still looks good!\nThe turkey still looks good.\n[screaming]\n[sizzling]\nWait, what are you...\nIt is hot! My skin!\nIt's burning my skin!\nThe hell you doing?!\nIt was hot! It was hot!\nNow I got to eat a dirty turkey! What's wrong with you?\nGavin: This is all my fault.\nYou know I throw hot things!\nI'm so sorry.\nIt was fine!\nTurkey's expensive!\nAny more?\nThis isn't on me!\nFurguson don't eat turkey from the ground!\nNick: Oh, no. I'm not taking the fall for this one.\nIt's all on you!\nI'm not taking the...\nHey! Can we not yell at each other on Thanksgiving?!\nI recognize that I, too, am yelling.\nAnd I'm-I'm sorry, Robby.\nWait.\n[elevator doors shut]\n[sighs]\nGreat, he's gone.\n[sighs] I was just starting to feel it.\nGo.\nYeah, Jess, go.\nGo.\nGo!\nGo after him.\nSave us some floor turkey.\nHey.\nLook, I know you had high hopes for Thanksgiving with your dad.\nYou called it.\nThe guy is who he is.\nYou know, maybe you just need to drop this idea that he'll ever be the bigger man.\nI think that needs to be you, babe.\nYou're the bigger man.\nSon, I know you're probably tired of hearing both these statements and not likely to believe either, but...\nI'm leaving and I'm sorry.\nDad, I said... I said a lot of things earlier.\nI don't want you out of my life.\nI was waiting for you to be someone who you're not, but...\nI know who you are and I still love you.\nBut you-you need to listen to me, son to father, get a therapist.\nOh, I have a therapist.\nA better one.\nOkay.\nAnd I shouldn't have to say this but one that you're not sleeping with.\nOkay.\nWait! Robby! Robby, don't go.\nI tried to Irish good-bye, but, uh, I'm moving a little slow.\nWhen you were in there and you were saying all those things, I realize I don't even really know you.\nAnd I want to get to know you.\nJess, it's okay. I-I don't want you to force something that's not there.\nI felt it.\nYou felt the oomph?\nYes. I... [sighs]\nI'm sorry I'm being so confusing.\nI-I think I'm as bad at Thanksgiving as I am at starting new relationships.\nYeah, you're pretty bad.\nRobby, will you go on another date with me?\n Come on, baby, make it hurt so good. \n[chuckles]\nHell yeah, I'll go on another date with you.\nHmm.\nI did already tell my mom about Phoenix though.\nI hope that's okay.\nOh, of course.\nI apologize in advance for the state of our main course.\n \nDad, would you like to do the honors?\nI think the man of the house traditionally does that.\n I am a house \nAw.\n Out of twigs and stones \nI'm the m... I'm the man of the house.\nWould you look at that?\n[phone buzzes, chimes]\nOh, it's Reagan.\nOh, whoa. You know, I've always wanted to do this.\nUh, read out loud.\nFemale voice: In Omaha. Heart emoji.\nSmiling pile of poo emoji.\nI want my tongue emoji on your monkey emoji.\nEh, come on, that's a little private. S-Sorry about that.\nShe wants to tongue your monkey?\nWhat's your monkey?\nSmiling pile of poo?\nJess: Oh, my God, Schmidt and Cece will be in a new home next year.\nNext year it's at our place.\nHappy last loft Thanksgiving, everyone.\n Give and give \nThey weren't always perfect, but they were memorable.\nCheers.\nCheers.\nHey. [whoops]\nHey.\nCece: Mmm. Remember when you fell down that hole?\nOh, and Schmidt cooked the meal in our dead neighbor's kitchen.\n[laughing]: Ms. Beverly.\nMmm!\nRemember when we had sex with strangers?\nJess: That's a misrepresentation of what happened.\nRemember when your parents made it in the bathroom?\nOr last Thanksgiving, when we all accidentally took peyote and, Winston, you wouldn't let us break the wishbone.\nBreak the bone, lose the wish.\nThat's not true!\nThat's not how it works.\nThat is not how it works.\nNick: Here's to Thanksgiving, everybody.\n[cheering]\n"}, {"title": "06x08 - James Wonder.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nBabe, can you help me finish this thank you card to Asha Auntie?\nShe got us... that.\nSchmidt: That porpoise p0rn?\nYeah.\n\"Best, comma, Cece and Schimdt.\"\nAll we're gonna give her is a \"Best, comma\"?\nCome on, she's my mom's sister.\nWell, she should have stuck to the registry.\nYou know who hasn't even gotten us a present yet?\nI have a year.\nHe has a year.\nI have a year!\n[door closes]\nAll right, everyone.\nReport to the principal's office, where I will be sitting behind the desk because...\nI might be principal!\nCongrats!\nThat's great!\nWhat do you mean, could be principal?\nWell, I just had a very interesting talk with my boss, Genevieve.\nJess, I am dying.\nWhat? Oh, my God!\nDying to leave Banyon Canyon and launch my own elementary school at sea.\nOh. You scared the bejesus out of me.\nI've wanted this forever and I came so close at my last school.\nLike, champagne and Prosecco close.\nSo, if you find marijuana in a locker, it's yours now.\nOurs now. It could just be part of the loft.\nWe could just put it in a...\nCongratulations.\nYou just got yourself two weeks detention, Mr. Miller.\nWhat? But I didn't do anything!\nI didn't do anything!\n[sighs]\n \nPrincipal, that's great. I'm really proud of you.\nAnd now you're almost gonna make what normal people make.\nBut I'm not even in it for the cabbage.\nI want to change lives.\nAnd finally, I can implement some of my programs school-wide, like the math decathlon... the demathlon.\nA-ha!\n[Winston laughing]\nYou see this whole time, y'all thought you were having breakfast with Winston, but it turns out y'all been sitting with James Wonder.\nI'm talking about my alias.\nSee, I'm thinking about applying for undercover work.\nThat sounds incredibly dangerous.\nWell, not if I go deep enough into my undercover character.\nI've been practicing on y'all unknowin' asses.\nI combined the names of my favorite singers...\nStevie Wonder and James Blunt.\nAnd I put those together to create a different name as my alias, James Wonder.\nI'm worried you're not the undercover type of guy.\nI feel like if you had the ability to pretend to be someone else, you would have made that decision a long time ago.\nI feel like that sounded harsh, but it's only 'cause I care about you.\nJess: I love Parents' Day!\nMatching names to e-mail addresses, puttin' big people in little chairs.\nAdmiring all that sweet daddy derriere.\nYeah, I'm not doing that.\nGood. More for me.\nOoh. That is Ed Warner.\nPresident of the parent's council.\nYou're gonna need his vote if you want to become principal, so...\nOkay, did you talk me up?\nAbsolutely not.\nSchool politics gets messy and as my grandmother used to say, \"You don't get dirty till after 6:30.\"\nPiece of cake. Parents love me.\nEd!\nOh, are-are you okay?\n[chuckling]: Sorry, I was, uh, moved to tears by the... second grader's self-portraits.\nI cannot believe you are gonna abandon us next year.\nOh...\nI'm like, \"Ah, don't go!\"\n[imitating Genevieve]: I can keep the accent so you'll barely notice she's gone.\n[chuckles awkwardly]\nPrince Henry, pet me corgi.\nWow.\nUm, Ed, have you met our vice principal?\nJessica Day. I'm a big fan of your work and by your work, I mean the child you created.\nNot to suggest that it was work making her.\nI'm sure it was fun.\nI mean... I hope it was fun.\nEd, if you're gonna ask me sex advice, please buy me a glass of wine first.\n[Jess chuckles]\n[clears throat]\nAnyway, switching gears.\nI'd love to discuss the, uh, principal vacancy.\nAs would I.\nN-not now.

What are you doing here?\nAnd before you answer that question, get out of here!\nWinston? Can't you read?\nYou said I couldn't do it, but I did it.\nI am deep undercover right now.\nNo one's gonna believe you're a parent here.\nEd: Jimmy-dubs!\nWhere'd you go?\nI needed a refill on the java, E-dawg.\n[chuckles]\nJess: Oh, my goodness!\nI see you've already met and also, already have '90s hip-hop nicknames for each other.\nGenevieve, this is James Wonder.\nHey.\nA potential new dad.\nHe's a landscape architect.\nOh....\nAnd father of Asher.\nAnd husband of?\nI... I'm a widower.\nOh, oh...\nYeah. Yeah, she, um... she got squished.\nSquished?\nMm-hmm.\nDid she? Did she?\nOkay, James. Uh, let's leave now so I can show you the school's landscaping.\nEd: Wait, actually, I have a stubborn back yard.\nUh, I don't want to bring in frogs, but if I could attract frogs...\nVery common situation in our business.\nYou need a well.\nA well?\nOh. Well, you need to let me buy you a bottle of wine and pick your brain about all this.\n[laughs]\nThat sounds good, E-dawg. We should...\nBut... but right now, I should get going.\nYeah.\nI got a butt load of koi fish in the back of my truck that need bonding.\nPlease, let me show you out.\nTake my hand. Oh, God. Did I say breast?\nI meant... I meant hand.\nJess: Uh, hey. Hey, Ed.\nI'd love to circle back around to that principal conversation.\nLet me just stop you there, Miss Day.\nUm, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I think I speak for every parent at Banyon Canyon when I say, you're just not a good fit.\nWh-what? I am a perfect fit.\nI have my reasons. [chuckles]\nExcuse me, I have, uh...\n[smacks lips]\nGood-bye.\nI'm making this for Genevieve. I'm...\nI gotta convince her to make my case to Ed.\nMy man, Ed.\nListen Jess, I could go ahead and give him a call if you like.\nAll you have to do is say the word.\nNo, no, no, no. This is no country for James Wonder.\nI'm not having you go undercover at school again.\nNo offense, but you kind of fell out of your dress when Genevieve came on to you.\nI did get rattled. I have a girlfriend, and I adore Ally.\nBut everything else I'm doing seems to be working because Ed loves me.\nYou know, he wants James to landscape his yard.\nSo I drew him four sketches.\nWow. Winston, these are actually really good.\nI don't remember drawing these.\nI woke up this morning, and they were under my pillow.\n[groans]\nHey, Nick...\nWould you be interested in rubble from old Yankee Stadium?\nWhat, for my rubble collection?\nI'm having a really hard time finding something for you.\nI thought I was just gonna go on the Internet, but the Internet is so different now.\nHave you been on the Internet lately?\nHow drunk are you?\nI remember when the Internet used to just be a naked lady and a bunch of dancing hamsters.\nHow drunk are you, Nick?\nI literally haven't had one thing to drink.\nHow many drinks have you had?\nGive me a breathalyzer.\nIt feels like you're drunk.\nZ-Y-X-N-L-P-A.\nYou're hammered.\nI'm drunk.\nNick, whatever you get us, we're going to love.\nIt... it doesn't matter.\nI don't know what to get you, and it matters, it matters!\nIt doesn't matter.\nIt doesn't matter!\nJust get us something!\n[shouting]: There's a registry.\nYou go on it, and you pick something!\nNow you've got Schmidt all cranked up.\nYou're cranked up?\nYeah, I got to go to the arcade now and blow off steam!\nI didn't mean to crank you up.\n\n\n\nHey, Cece.\nHey, hey.\nI don't know what to do.\nI want to get you something great, but I can't find anything on the Internet.\nHere's the truth. I'd give you my heart.\nI'd rip it out of my chest but... but then I would literally die.\nBut you know that, you're studying to be a nurse.\nNo, I'm not.\nYou're already a nurse?\nNot a nurse.\nBut you went to college didn't you?\nWhy didn't you just give us the Vitalstir?\nBecause then it would just end up in a landfill in a year when they come out with a Vitalstir 3001.\nWell, I imagine they'd go to 4000.\nDo you think that they have made 3,000 different Vitalstir models?\nDo you really think they've perfected this blender in four tries?\nYou're not a nurse. [laughs]\nLook, I know what you're struggling with right now, okay?\nYou want to get us something that's unique.\nIt's got to be great. It's got to be from me to you.\nAlright, here's a little exercise... close your eyes.\nNow, first thing that comes to your mind.\nImagine something that is unique, it's permanent.\nI got it!\nOkay, you got to open your eyes before you go, you drunk.\nLet me give you the, uh, keys so you can close up.\nOh, no. I put two hands in at the same time again.\n[straining]\nI did it again.\nI can't find this James Wonder anywhere.\nI just wanted to say hi, and I want to send him a password-protected video I thought he might enjoy.\nWell, I just brought you a little gift.\nI know what you're doing. Jess, I have told you I can't afford to get involved in school politics.\nPlease, Genevieve. I'm begging you.\nThere's no delicate way to say this so I'm going to be... incredibly cruel.\nThey don't like you.\nAt all.\nOw.\nThey despise you.\nAll right. I got it.\n\"Get rid of Jess.\"\nYikes.\nThese aren't my words, Jess.\nI'm just repeating what I'm hearing.\n\"Jess is the worst.\"\nOkay.\n\"Can't stand the sight of her.\"\nDon't need all of it.\nDo you understand what I am saying?\nYeah.\nThey've asked me to move on with my search.\nWait a minute.\nHuh?\nWould you talk me up to Ed if I could tell you where he was having dinner?\nWith James Wonder?\nWinston.\nYou need to say the words, Jess.\nI need your help.\nI need your help, who?\nI need your help, James Wonder.\nWell, then, my help you shall have.\nWhat'd he say? Is he going to help?\nHere is your mission.\nYou're going too down to Brickfield and you're going to facilitate a conversation about me... with Ed...\nMy man.\n... and Genevieve.\nI'm out.\nPlease, Winst...\nJames Wonder.\nShe wants to have sex with me.\nI know you love Ally, but James Wonder is still grieving.\nLean into the character.\nThis is your chance to prove that you can do undercover work.\nPlease?\nAll right, I'll do it. Under one condition.\nThat I...\nNo, I don't have any conditions.\nOkay.\nI design all the landscaping, and my crew... my crew, they do all the dirty work.\nIf you were my boss I would be employee of the month every single day.\nWinston [over phone speaker]: All right then.\nOh, jeez, Genevieve, stop flirting, get to me!\nAre you shouting at a podcast again, Jess?\nYou know it can't hear you, right?\nShh!\nSpeaking of bosses, Ms. Day has done some amazing work.\nStrong disagree.\nUh, what is your ish with her?\nShe sets our kids up for failure.\nWhat?!\nEd: This ridiculous... math decathlon... ugh!\nIt is competitive and demeaning.\nIt is hard enough out there for these kids.\nAffluent children in Los Angeles do have it hard.\nExactly.\nSamanthia bombed that dumb thing, never got a medal, and now she's lost her appetite for soosh!\nThat's what he's mad at?\nMy version of the demathlon is way less rigorous than the South Korean teacher I copied it from.\nEither bring the phone over here where we can hear it, or stop talking to it.\nHe's saying that unless I drop the demathlon, I'll never be principal.\nGenevieve: James.\nI am trouble after two glasses.\nSo why don't you pour me a third?\n[laughing heartily]\n[nervous chuckle]\nDo it. Do it. Do it. Do it.\nOkay. Mm-hmm. O-okay.\nDo it. Do it!\nOkay. Okay.\n[laughing]\nStop it! Stop it!\nI'm going to get crazy.\nYou're making me crazy.\nI did it.\nBest present ever.\nPlease. I'm trying to eavesdrop on Winston's alter ego.\n[chuckling] Oh...\nGenevieve: James.\nHmm?\nYou seem troubled.\nNo, I don't.\nYou must be holding a lot of sadness in your legs.\nI have hands like a bonobo... strong.\nOh, wow. [nervous chuckle]\nThere we go.\nOoh. Very good.\nAah!\nOw! Now, no! I have a girlfriend.\nHer name is Ally.\nNo. No. No. No. No.\nWasn't your wife recently squished?\nYeah. That-that happened.\nShe was indeed...\nBut then, we cremated her.\nAnd we, we, we had to dry her out first.\nUgh. He's scrambling like a damn egg!\nI got to get in there.\nWait, you got to see my gift!\nWho are you, James Wonder?\n[chuckles]\nI'm just a... a combination of my two favorite singers.\nI'm about to gift your brains to pieces.\nYou got to real pull-the-rip-cord-while-still-in-the-plane kind of vibe, Nick.\nIt's a little something from me... to you.\nAll right.\nOr, more accurately, on me.\n[laughing] Check it out.\nI got the best gift.\nIt is your faces, but it's not your bodies.\nI didn't have a full body shot so...\nWow!\n.. they picked the bodies.\nSchmidt: Is that Pretty Woman?\nThis is from the movie Pretty Woman and it's on me forever.\n[laughs]\nSay something.\n[nervous chuckle]\nSay something.\nIt-it's cute, it's really cute.\nI really did it.\nTalk to me about how happy you are.\nIt's on me forever.\nSchmidt: I know we're on you forever and ever, until you're buried in a non-Jewish cemetery.\nCece: And now we-we owe you a... a thank you card.\nJust don't know where I'm gonna find the words to express all of the emotions that I'm feeling right now.\n[laughs]\nI can't find anything about you online, James.\nNot even the darknet.\nOh, I was gonna say, you checked the darknet, yeah?\nI'm usually on there, they usually got some stuff about me.\nHey!\nWinston: Oh, thank God. Jess... ica Day.\nI can't believe you guys are all at my favorite restaurant.\nHey, does anyone have a red landscaping truck?\n'Cause it's getting towed.\nAnyone? Red landscaping truck?\nNo, mine's white.\n[clears throat]\nWell, it could be white.\nIt's getting towed.\nI-I did take the red one today.\nYeah, can't let that get towed.\nMy crew is napping in the back.\nYup.\nWell...\n[chuckling]: Hey.\nThis is an unexpected treat.\nWell, I'm happy to have ran into you because, um...\nI've been thinking, and...\nI'm canceling the demathlon.\nReally?\nYeah.\nBut I thought you loved the math decathlon?\nIt's a holdover from my old public school days.\nIt's unnecessarily competitive.\nOld habits die hard.\nThat's true, you know, I still eat a ton of meat and I've been vegetarian for years.\nLike, a ton.\nA ton of meat.\nI mean, I didn't realize you were so amenable.\nHey, actually, Samanthia loves puppets.\nWhat would you say if I asked you to introduce ventriloquism into the curriculum?\nAnd do less math?\nI'd say...\n[in puppet voice]: You got it!\n[clears throat]\nGreat.\n[both chuckle]\n\"Sincerely\"?\n\"Sincerely\"?\n\"Dear Nick, thanks for the tattoo.\n\"Sincerely, S and Cece.\"\nYou guys hate my gift?\nNo, we don't hate it, we love it, I see it every time I blink.\nYou guys want to see it?\nIt's okay.\nAh, I'll show it anyhow.\nCheck it out. There's an ingrown hair that gives Cece a bit of a Rudolph nose.\nAnd when I flex my feet it makes you guys fatter. Look.\nFat, look how fat your face looks, Schmidt.\n[laughs] You have the fattest face in the world.\nAll right, stop it! Stop the horror!\nWe hate the gift.\nIt's disgusting.\nIt is disgusting.\nYou've ruined your leg.\nIt is like you stole our souls.\nYou depicted my wife as a common street whore.\nFine, you don't want it?\nYou can't have it.\nI'll get it removed and we can go about our lives again in a week.\nYou know it costs, like, two grand and takes a year or something, right?\nWell, I did not know that.\nOkay?\nI didn't know that.\nWell, that really sucks for me.\nBut fine, then that's your present.\nThat's not a present. Look Nick, I appreciate you trying to do something meaningful for us, but just give us the blender you bought.\nWell, the jokes on you, I burnt out the motor making a bubble gum smoothie.\nYou're back on the registry then.\nI won't do it! It's a list made by robots.\nIdiot! Trying to get me something meaningful!\nThe only thing meaningful to me is the blender!\nRemember to bring your pets to school next week for human zoo day.\nYeah.\nOh, and I'd also like to let everyone know that we are switching back from this soap to this soap, okay?\nSo just be aware.\nNext, I would like to offer my personal endorsement of Jessica Day as our next principal.\n[applause]\nAll right, well, first, I'd love to open up the floor to questions.

Let's just let this chicken marinate.\nSo, what are we looking at here?\nUh, open relationship?\nFriends with benefits?\nThe old \"dog and bone\" situation?\nWe're just two people hanging out in a cool and modern way.

[chuckles]\nThat's fresh from the sarcasm factory, [laughs] 'cause it is fascinating.\nThought you would've mentioned that before.\nYou guys ask me surprisingly little about my personal life.\nYou're okay with this, right?\nI mean, you wanted to see other people.\nYeah. Yeah, I definitely said that.\nYeah, I actually have a date, too.\nYou do?\nMm-hmm.\nWith who?\nShh, trailers are starting.\nOkay, this way. Come on in.\nWait, so Robby has a date? That was so fast.\nThe man didn't waste any time.\nBut you know what? It's okay, 'cause I'm dating, too.\nBut you aren't, though. Your guy's fake.\nCan we come back to Robby designing factories?\nThe man is an enigma.\nHe's my second best friend, and I know nothing about him.\nNow, can we please focus?\nWe are doing a formal walkthrough.\nBehold, the kitchen of tomorrow.\nWhere are the dang walls?!\nMr. Jason said one week at the latest.\nNo!

No!\nUh, a minute alone with the boy?\nHey, bud.\nNick...\nI am at my wit's end here.\nShould I call the Better Business Bureau?\nBetter Business Bureau... that's not a real thing...\nIt's a very real thing... and as a man who co-owns a small business with you, I'm alarmed.\nYou just got to know how to talk to these people.\nSchmidt: There's Mr. Jason over there.\nSee the brunette with his arms crossed?\nNick: Okay, let me take a crack at this.\nAnd don't call men brunettes.\nWe've talked about this before.\nThat's a nice grain.\nGreat grain.\nGot to cut with the grain.\nUh, always.\nWatch the fingers.\nIt's a living.\nGet the hands dirty.\nYeah, you know, early bird gets the worm.\n[laughs]\nClean your jeans.\nAsk her what time it is, she'll tell you to build a watch, you know?\n[both laugh]\nWould you look at that?\nIt's good, though. It's good framing.\nAh, it's beautiful, stuff, yeah.\nThese guys are good.\nYou guys have done beautiful stuff.\nWhere does a modern girl go to make a fake guy real?\nThat is an insane combination of words.\nIt's not the Internet, a bar or a nightclub, 'cause I'm uncomfortable with all those.\nYou're taking a lot of options off the table.\nAnd are you sure you're just not scared to get serious with Robby because you don't want to get hurt?\nNo, I'm not scared, I just... don't want to start a relationship with someone I barely know.\nI mean, he has a boat.\nWhat's next, a kid?\nAnd then I have to meet the boat and the kid at some weird sea luncheon?\nHonestly, playing the field sounds really exciting to me.\nYou know, going to strange places with strange men.\nSign me up for that.\nYou know, that certainly sounds like you, Jess.\nYou know what, you should just start right now.\nThere's a lot of guys here.\nYou should go and... talk to one.\nAt a construction site?\nWe... support it.\nJess: Okay, I can't tell if you're mocking me... but fine, I'll go have a look around.\nFine.\nFine.\nI see what you did there.\nYeah, the quicker this plays out, the sooner she'll realize how ridiculous she's being.\nNow, I'm not trying to break stones over here, but what can we do about these walls?\nI can't do the walls until they do the electric, and I can't do the electric without my guy.\nYou got to have your guy, I get it, but what am I gonna do?\nJason: If I could I would, but I'm not Santa Claus. What do you want me to do?\nWhat? Do I need to get your mother out here to do it?\n'Cause I'll call your mother. I got her in my phone.\nYou're gonna call my mother?\nYeah, I'm gonna call your mother.\nAll right, you sack of crap.\n[laughing]\nI'll make a call.\nThank you.\nAll right.\nGreat!\nWhat the hell was that?\nOh, he's gonna call his guy... he's gonna see what he can do about the walls.\nThank goodness. I thought it was gonna be a physical altercation.\nNah, he's a good guy, he's a good guy.\nSalt of the earth.\nIt's more about what's unsaid, you know?\nWhat it comes down to at the end of the day is respect.\nAnd I have it for him and he has it for me.\nInteresting.\nSo Mr. Jason doesn't respect me?\nOh, God, no.\nHmm.\nI mean, Schmidt, I love you, but... but you're not a man of the people.\nOf course I'm not a man of the people... I'm above the people.\nI want the people to build things for me.\nAnd that's where I come in.\nI can't rely on your... crass Chicago street smarts forever.\nI'm a homeowner, and I'm a husband, and hopefully, one day I'll be a father.\nIf he's not gonna respect me, then I need to become someone that he will.\nThat sounds a little scary.\nWho-who are you looking to become, Schmidt?\nYou.\nUgh.\nAnyway, if any of you gentlemen are looking for something modern and non-exclusive...\nYou got a nail in your ass.\nOh. Um, that's not my ass, that's actually my dress. [groans]\nCould one of you guys help me?\nNo, we're busy right now.\nCome on.\nOh. Thank you...\nEs good?\nEs very good. [chuckles]\nMm! So, how's Babs?\nIs she puttin' out?\n[both laughs]\nWell, she's great. I-I haven't gone out with her yet, but I look forward to getting to know her in a relaxed and modern way.\nGreat.\nI'm ready to tell you about my guy now.\nHis name is Stavros, and he is Greek, which is exciting.\nThat's... very exciting.\nYeah...\nHe sounds... sounds very sexy.\nI can't believe she met a man at a construction site.\nI mean, I'm kind of impressed.\nHe thinks it's really funny how big our drinks are.\nThey are big.\nI'm concerned Robby doesn't care.\nThey're testing each other.\nLook at his bottom lip.\nStavros is taking me to a club on Friday.\nAh. Yeah... okay. I get it. He cares.\nOkay, uh... we were supposed to go out on Friday.\nOh! I'm sorry. You know what?\nShould I cancel?\nNo. It's okay.\nI'll just go out on Friday with Babs.\nSounds fun.\nIt's gonna be fun.\nOr... crazy idea.\nWhat if we all hang out together?\nVery interesting. Like a double date?\nThat seems precarious.\nOh, it's totally just gonna blow up in their faces, and they're gonna need us when it does, so we should probably be on call.\nAbsolutely. Yeah.\nWe're a very important part of this.\nWhat'd I tell you? They're putting the electrical in.\nTa-da!\nDon't say ta-da around these guys.\nAnd why are you wearing my clothes?\nI'm you.\nYou are making this way creepier than it needs to be.\nBut let's work on your stance, okay?\nOkay.\nYou're gonna want to adjust your pants a lot, like watch me.\nLike this. Just like looking around, checking it out, adjust your pants; try it.\nJust do it normal, just do it normal.\nDon't make that face.\nRegular face.\nIf you're gonna do anything with your shoulders, it's this.\nJust relax...\nNo. You're doing this...\nDon't do that here. It's like this...\nOkay, let's try something else.\nI think you-you need to slouch a little bit, 'cause all these people have back pain.\nLook, I'm sorry that I have good posture.\nI'm not on my hands and knees all day slapping hot tar on a roof.\nI'm sitting in an ergonomic office chair like a frickin' gentleman.\nSo, here's a way to give a compliment.\nIt's... you insult somebody, that's a way to show affection.\nLike, hey, you ugly piece of crap, you got humongous ears.\nSo you're too insecure to show affection, so you do the opposite.\nAnd if you're ever in a pinch, and the moment's getting on top of you, just mention the game.\n[whispering]: You got this, man.\nYou got this.\nHey, what's up dum-dum?\nI'm sorry, I was breaking so much balls before.\nI had a really stressful day at the office.\nYou know, the, uh, boss was really giving it to me, so I kicked his ass, but I'm better.\nHey, uh, I know how it goes, bud.\nSo now that we have the electrical, maybe we can get started on the walls?\nWh-what do you say, bud?\nOh, uh, we're gonna have to wait on the inspection.\nAnd that could take a few months.\nA few months?!\nAny way we could speed this process along?\nWhat do you say, you dirty slut?\nSlut?\nLook, this a city issue.\nBut we could, uh, throw a little money at the situation.\nSee what we see.\nThrow a little bit of money, see what we see.\nWho do I make the check out to? Los Angeles?\nOr ma-make it to cash.\nThere you go.\nYeah. All right.\nNow we're talking. Ow!\nCaught a little bit of my ween in there.\nYou all right?\nJust the tip, just the tip of the ween.\nOkay.\nJess: Wow.\nYour house is amazing.\nWho lives here, Vin Diesel?\nNo. But we do share a gardener.\nThis is Stavros.\nHe brought homemade wine.\nThank you, Stavros. Looks, uh, very fresh.\n[Stavros speaking Greek]\nIs that right?\nDoes he speak English?\nNo. But his last name has 17 consonants, which I find very charming.\nSure.\nSo where's Babs?\nPutting her grandkids to bed?\n[chuckles]\nHey.\n[gasps]\nI'm Babs.\n[chuckling]: This is gonna be fun.\nTo life!\nThis bottle's very warm.\nSo, Babs, um, you work at the factory with Robby?\nI'm the head engineer.\nRobby: Babs is a genius physicist.\nShe got her doctorate from Cambridge.\nWow. I didn't...\nI mean, that's very impressive.\nStavros is from a rich tradition of, uh, craftsman.\nWithout men like him, we wouldn't have houses to live in, or delicious wine to drink with friends.\n[chuckling]: Salud.\nSalud.\nYamas.\n[all gagging, except Stavros]\n[choking]: Oh... it burns.\nEs good?\nEs good.\nEs good?\nIt's good.\n\n\n\nIs that a gold record on your wall?\nRobby: Hmm?\nOh, yeah. I-I played bass on a Santana album.\nWho are you?\nYeah, there's... there's no updates yet.\nI wonder how it's going.\nMm, mm, mm.\nWaiter has my credit card, in case we need to leave, we're ready.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nHey, let me ask you something.\nYou think we're too involved in Robby and Jess?\nIt could be argued that this is a little unhealthy.\nMm.\nWhat does it really say about us, you know?\nAre we just so bored with our own lives now that we're settled and in love?\nNah, that's not what's happening here, okay? [laughs]\nWe're not bored.\nRight.\nAll right. I got a lot of stuff going on.\nYeah.\nWhoo-ho.\nLet me start from the top.\nOkay.\nLet me tell you, last week?\nYeah.\nI had ants in my room.\nYeah. What else, what else, what else, what else?\nOoh, I think I'm gonna try the crab breast.\nDid it.\nSure did.\nYou know what's crazy?\nNot only did I get Mr. Jason to respect me, but I think I learned to respect him a little bit, too.\nI like the people; so wild and lazy.\nIf you want, I could take you to the store I get my jeans.\nIt's actually just a Mexican supermarket.\nGive it to me.\nI got it.\nGive it to me...\nYou okay?\nGive it to me.\nLook at the suds.\nYou ruined a beer.\nSchmidt: Ah, there he is.\nHey-o. Working late.\nSo, Mr. Jason, did we get the inspection, or are we gonna keep waiting around like a couple of jamooks?\nEh, threw some sawdust on the puddle, but it's still wet.\nI don't know... is that a bad thing or good thing?\nMeans he didn't get it.\nHey, blame the city.\nI hate the city!\nStup-stupid city.\nWell, you know what, Mr. Jason? You tried.\nThank you for that.\nI guess you can just give us our money back.\nOh, I don't have your money.\nWe didn't get the inspection, though.\nWell, I said we'd see what we see.\nAnd this is what we saw...\nYou get it.\nI don't think that I do get it. Do we get it, Nick?\nDo I, do I... I don't get it.\nDo you get it?\nI get it.\nAren't those the copper pipes for our bathroom?\nThese are extra.\nI'm gonna use them on another job.\nNick: Oh, at another job.\nOh, it... and he left with them.\nWhat does he do? I don't understand...\nWhat's happening? What is happening?\nOh, I get it. I get it.\nWe got ripped off.\nGod... I knew it.\nHow did I not see this coming?\nMaybe I've lost touch with the people.\nServes me right being such a damn success.\nI'm sitting in my ivory tower like Dan Brown!\nNick, you're a very talented writer, but you're no Dan Brown.\nYou've never even had anything published.\nWell, if I'm no Dan Brown, and I'm no man of the people, then who am I?\nStop having an identity crisis! Now is not the time.\nWhat we need to do is come up with a plan that combines both of our strengths.\nI like this.\nHere's what I'm thinking.\nWe invite Mr. Jason over for the game.\nAnd while I'm hosting the hell out of him, you sneak down, and you steal those pipes out of his truck.\nLet's do this, man! Let's do this!\nNobody rips us off.\nNobody rips us off!\nLet's do it!\nI think what you wanted to do was more like that.\nWhy didn't mine break?\nIt's really easy to break it, you just...\n[grunting]\nTen seconds.\nTen seconds.\nChoiros. Choiros chrimata!\nWhat does that mean?\nWhat does that mean?\nChoiros chrimata!\nWhat does that mean?\nI think, I think he's saying \"pig money.\" Is it pig money?\nTime!\n[laughter]\nWell, it was piggy bank, which is close enough.\nWe gave you \"garbanzos\" for \"chick peas.\"\nI'm afraid we cannot allow it, Jess.\nMan, we are wrecking you guys.\nIt's probably 'cause me and Babs have, uh, such a strong connection.\nWhatever. It's just 'cause you speak the same language.\nI like to date people that I can communicate with.\nGood for you. Where's the wine?\nI like it now.\nI think it's making me hallucinate.\nMm-hmm. Me, too.\nYou know what? It's of good quality.\n Last night I thought to back when we made good love... \nOh, you're singing now?\n Listenin' to some Marvin Gaye \n All night long... \n[singing atonal Greek folk song]\n[Jess sings along, trying to copy him]\n[singing continues]\n Good loving body rocking \n Knocking boots \n[Stavros and Jess sing]\n All night long \n[Stavros and Jess sing]\n All night long... \nEnough!\nWhat is wrong with you, Robby?\nWhat's wrong with me?\nYou're the one who wanted to see other people!\nI said I wanted to take it slow.\nI didn't say I want a front row seat to your date with some movie scientist.\nThis is a weird night.\nWell, welcome to my world, Babs.\nJess, you don't know what you want.\nI mean, do you like me? Do you not like me?\nAre we in a relationship? Are we not?\n[singing in Greek]\nThank you, Stavros. That'll do.\nI'm gonna go.\n[groans slightly]\nYeah, well...

Your turn.\nWell, Jess, Christmas is just so stressful... with the lists and the lines and-and the dancing girls at TV Town Song Room.\nTV Town Song Room?\nDo you mean Radio City Music Hall?\nYeah.\nHow could you get so many things wrong in a row?\nAt Radio City Music's Hall.\nWhat is going on here?\nChristmas isn't stressful.\nBabe.\nBabe.\nCece: You get more stressed out by Christmas than anyone I know.\nThe spirit of Christmas.\n[electrical hissing, booming clack]\nSon of a whore!\nWhoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.\n[yelling]\nIn my defense, I hadn't slept for six days.\nBut I do see your point.\nOkay. Great.\nHmm.\nSo it's official. Christmas is canceled.\nNo, Christmas is not canceled.\nChristmas gifts are how you show the people you love that you care in a very special, magical and highly mandatory way.\nYou want me to shop until I drop, and I don't want to drop.\nHow about this? One special gift, one person, and a guessing game at the end.\nSecret Santa!\nOne moment, please.\n[Jess sighs]\n[whispering]\nIt's the perfect compromise. Come on.\n[gavel banging]\nGeneral agreement.\nNick: General agreement.\nSure.\nWe can do it.\nYes! It's a deal. Okay.\n[Nick screaming]\n[laughing] Whoa.\nOh.\nIt's just me.\nI'm feeling really good.\n \nMerry Christmas Eve Eve, everybody!\nSecret Santa starts tonight at 6:00 P.M., AKA 7:00 P.M. eve.\nSnacks will be potluck.\nI call baba ghanoush.\nIt brings back such good memories.\nMy dad waking me up with hot cocoa, my dog Frank dressed up as Rudolph, looking out the window, watching for snow, dancing around the Christmas tree to the sweet sounds of Darlene Love's \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).\"\nDarlene what now?\n The snow's coming down \nLove me some Darlene.\n I'm watching it fall \nWhat am I watching now?\nTwo kilos of uncut joy.\nLittle reminder... uh, tonight is for Secret Santa gifts only.\nSo, married people, please exchange your gifts at another time.\nCece: Oh, don't worry. Schmidt and I aren't getting each other gifts this year.\nUh-uh.\nIs that 'cause of the Jew thing?\nJew thing?\nThat's just a phrase that falls out of your mouth these days.\nOh, sorry.\nI-I took the last Jew thing.\nThis will be the only gift that Cece is getting this Christmas, so whoever has her, please step it up.\nCece: Right, and the same goes for my man.\nJust because he doesn't believe in the Lord, doesn't mean he can't have cake at the birthday party.\nSo, whoever has him better bring it... because I know I got the perfect gift for...\nJess: Up-bup-bup-bup!\nSecret Santa.\nAlso, to that point, we're all in danger of revealing ourselves through little clues such as... cave man wrapping skills.\nI got mozzarella sticks for fingers.\nYou're making this very stressful, Jess.\nNo, it's not, because we have a Secret Santa helper, and his name is...\n[door opens]\nRobby!\nWhoa!\nOh.\nOh.\nHow long you been out there, man?\nEh, long enough to make it weird.\nBut I could hear everything, though, so...\nSorry about the wait.\nOh, it's okay.\nI slept in a little bit.\n[laughs]\nRobby is going to wrap and label all of your gifts to ensure anonymity.\nI'm just gonna go wait in Jess' room.\nI look forward to working with you all.\nOh, I got to get back to work.\nI told the entire staff they can have three days off 'cause Christmas is usually dead at the bar.\nSo, it's just gonna be me and the receipts.\nSchmidt: You haven't done those yet?\nNick, our accountant needs them today.\nI know. It's the do date, So, I'm going to do them today.\nD-U-E, Nicholas.\nD-O-I-N-G-I-N-G.\nDoing. The doing date.\nAnd if you think about it, D-O-I-N-G shouldn't be doing.\nIt should be freaking \"doyng.\"\n[laughing]\nNick, you got 'em?!\nYou look like you should be paying child support in Florida.\nI get Nick the perfect gift, and then he goes and buys it for himself.\nWhat am I supposed to get him now?\nYou could get Nick some tap shoes, right?\nThey do make walking fun.\n[scoffs]\nI told you that about tap shoes, you tree.\nNow think, Jessica.\nYou're the greatest gift-giver of all time.\n[gasps] I've got it.\nWhatever it is, I got it covered.\nOh, no, Robby. What I'm giving him cannot be wrapped.\nIs it a memory?\nNo.\nAh.\nA house?\nNo.\n \nDamn it, man.\nFalse alarm.\nI thought that was the mailman with my Secret Santa gift.\nYes, I know, Winston.\nYou've run in here at least six times.\nYou know, now you can just track the package.\nI can?\nYes.\nLet's see. KXHD136.\nYou memorized the package tracking number, but you didn't know that you could use that number to track the package?\nWhat?!\n9:18 A.M. refused delivery?\nDid you refuse a package to Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo?\nListen to what you just asked. Of course I did.\nDamn it!\nDamn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!\nDamn it! Damn it! Damn it!\nDamn it, Schmidt!\nI am Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo!\nIt is my secret Santa alias.\nOh.\nYeah.\nDamn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!\nI don't have a gift for tonight now.\nWell, this is not my problem, Winston.\nOh, no, it is your problem.\nOh, you had me?\nI did not have Jess, I did not have Nick, I do not have you.\nIt's fairly obvious who I do have.\nI figured it out. You have Cece.\nOh.\nMy Cece.\nMy Cece can't go gift-less.\nI like to think of her as our Cece.\nYou screwed the pooch on this one, Winston.\nMe? I didn't screw the pooch.\nYes, you did.\nYou didn't sign for it!\nHow was I supposed to sign for Garage-A-Roo's package?\nYou and your dang old aliases.\nYou have a new alias every day, Winston.\nYes, but you should know it's me!\nGarage-A-Roo, Kenneth.\nBut it was me clearly! Kenneth, Kenneth.\nRick Smits, Big Poppy Jones.\nThese are the dumbest names I've ever heard!\nPontius Pilate.\nAKA idiot.\nMaybe that truck is still in the neighborhood.\nLet's go out and try and get it.\nWait!\nThis just became a Schmidt and a Jay Garage-A-Roo mess-around.\nFreakin' Jay Garage-A-Roo.\n[laughs]\nSo I fly you down. You are my gift to Nick.\nWhat do you say?\nI don't know, Jess.\nI mean, I have a really big pitch tomorrow.\nIt's a treatment for...\nI mean, the polite term is \"gravelly bowel syndrome.\"\nSo fly down for one night.\nWhat could be more romantic or magical?\nI will orchestrate the whole surprise.\nLighting, blocking, costumes...\nOkay, you know what?\nI... I'm in.\nYou are?\nI thought I was gonna have to give you the hard sell.\nThat's part of the reason why I'm in. But... also, I haven't seen Nick in a couple weeks, and I really miss his nonsense.\nAnd that ass... am I right?\nShe's in!\n[laughs]\nWhoo!\nRobby: Pope Francis, we have a miracle worker.\n[chuckles]\nThe only thing left to do is...\nHey, Nick.\nI, um, just am doing a little laundry.\nI got just enough room for your bedsheets.\nMay I do the honors?\nBut don't touch them... they're exactly how I like them.\nBut I'm really glad you called. The bar is an absolute zoo.\nI haven't even gotten to the receipts yet.\nWait-wait, what?\nThe point is, I'm swamped, and I'm not gonna make it for Secret Santa.\nWhat?\nI'm sorry.\nI'm just not gonna make it.\nJess, Nick is still gonna enjoy seeing Reagan, even if it means she's just gonna hang out with him at the bar.\nYeah, it's the thought that counts.\nYeah.\nIf you're in the lump of coal business!\nI have to go help Nick... so he can be here for the surprise.\nDid you get... No, you don't have a drink.\nYou got hot chocolate?\nWhat do you want, a beer?\nI'll get you in a second there, buddy.\nWeirdly, this is not the first time Nick has failed to mention elves in a crisis situation.\nCece: This is way worse than you said.\nI'm out of here... it's my day off, and... you know what, actually, I don't need more than that.\nWait, wait, no. Cece, I need your help.\nI need your help.\nWe have to get Nick home for Secret Santa.\nOoh, you have him.\nYes, I got Nick. I got Nick.\nReagan's flying out from Seattle.\nOh...\nAnd we're double-teaming him.\nOkay, listen to me very carefully, okay?\nYou mean \"tag-teaming.\"\nThis is the exact same thing that happened when you handed that checkout guy coupons, and said that we'd been scissoring all day.\nOh. He helped us with our bags. He was such a gentleman.\nNo, he was not.\nHey, what are you two doing here?\nWhat are all these elves doing here?\nThey just got off a shift at the mall.\nYou know, I've been thinking, since they're all regular size, my theory is it's a mall for giants.\nLet us help. We'll man the bar. You can hit the receipts.\nAh, it'll be fine.\nSomeone just has to give my Secret Santa gift. It's for...\nNo! Sorry.\nLook, I know you don't love Secret Santa, but... don't be alone on Christmas Eve Eve.\nBe with the people you love.\nAll right, you're right.\nI'll take the help.\nUh, time for the receipts, I guess.\nLet me go grab my calculator.\n[groans]\nWe have a lot of work to do.\nOne, two, three, four...\nWhoa! Whoa.\nExcuse me, uh, Deb, we need to check your trunk... we're looking for a package.\nIt is addressed to Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo.\nWhat a stupid name.\nTell it to your stupid wife, man... it's one of our inside jokes.\nYou two don't have inside jokes.\nMan, we got loads of inside jokes!\nMy turtleneck, uh, my trick hip, that \"Hok-fooey, Jean Luc!\"\nGet off my truck.\nPlease, it is Christmas Eve... Eve.\nThat's right.\nYes.\nThat's my night. So go home, and wait for your package.\nAll right, fine. [chuckles]\nOkay, whatever.\n[sighs heavily]\nYou know what, Deb, that's where you're wrong.\nThere was a time when we didn't need people like you.\nThere was a time where a man could go into a place, buy a thing and leave with that thing.\nAnd you weren't involved at all.\nYou lost me, Schmidt. What are you talking about?\nStores, Winston!\nOh, stores!\nI remember those.\nStores?\nWhat are you gonna do? Pay sales tax?\nPark?\n[laughing]\nStores!\nOh!\nBrick and mortar, baby!\n\n\n\n[shattering]\nI know that she loves me, so why won't she touch me?\nLarry, you've got to go home, okay?\nWhy isn't Nick gone?\nIt's been four hours.\nReagan's on a plane, Secret Santa's in an hour, I'm freaking out...\nWell, you can call me Ice Cube.\nBecause I'm done wrapping.\nThat is how you won me over.\nLook, the missing piece of the puzzle is Nick.\nI'm gonna go check in.\nOne hour till Secret Santa!\nGreat.\nYou ever done any Santa work at the Chatsworth Penney's?\nLarry?\nRobby!\n[crying, sniffling]\n[knocking]\nCome in.\nA little North Pole knock-knock. [chuckles]\nI finished.\nOh.\nThank you, Jess. And thank you for what you said about being with the people you care about on Christmas.\nOh, you're welcome. I-I meant it.\nAnd that is why I bought a ticket... to go to Seattle to be with Reagan tonight.\nOh... Fa...\n La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la. \n[laughs]\nAll right. How do I surprise Reagan.\nHere's what I'm thinking.\nI'm thinking I go dressed as a fireman, I knock on the door, I reveal myself to be a stripper, and then I reveal myself to be Nick.\nHow does that even... uh...\nAre you sure you want to go to Seattle?\nI mean, it's Seattle. Ew.\nI mean, it was... it was basically your idea, right?\nWhy don't we just get you home to...\nI got no time.\nI'm on a no-fly list, so I need to leave right now.\nChecking in is very difficult.\nWhy not just take that name literally, and you no fly?\nOff to Seattle.\nWait, Nick! No! No!\nI can't let you go! Your hair looks so stupid!\nWhat?\nYou look like a total dork.\nMy hair looks stupid, I look like a total dork?\nWe can't let TSA see you like this.\nBut I've had this haircut for a little bit now.\nI know.\nYou let me go to work, though?\nIt just looks particularly bad right this minute.\nThen I'll just go like this.\nHow about now?\nNo. Mm-mm. Didn't fix it.\nI get the impression you don't want me to go to Seattle.\nThat's because I don't want you to go to Seattle.\nWell, why not?\nI can't tell you.\nI mean, I-is this about Reagan?\nDo you not like her?\nNo, I like Reagan... she looks like the front of a ship come alive. Heh.\nIs that why you've been acting so weird?\nI haven't been acting weird.\nYou've been weird since the day I got back from New Orleans.\nYou're acting really squirrelly.\nYou don't think I've noticed, but I've noticed.\nOkay, you're way off base.\nI mean, what is it? I took your advice...\nI'm gonna be with somebody who I find really special on Christmas.\nNick...\nBut, surprise, I've still done something wrong.\nDon't go to Seattle. Trust me.\nWhy is nothing I do ever good enough for you?\nWhat do you want from me?\nI'm doing everything I can here!\nNick, I'm flying Reagan out from Seattle to surprise you.\nI'm your Secret Santa, you jerk.\nSo this is what it feels like to be instantly sorry.\nSchmidt: Where is everyone?\nI thought this place would be crazy.\nHa-ha-ha!\nYeah, those were the days.\nNow people prefer to shop online.\nMy grandfather opened this store.\nNow it closes with me. So, to answer your question, yes, I do drink.\nUm... hey, we're looking for a beanbag chair.\nHey! We have one.\nNice!\nHeck, I'll go get it for you. I'm not doing anything.\nGreat, great.\nBrick and mortar, baby.\n[sighs]\nA beanbag chair, Winston?\nYeah.\nYou thought that would be a... a suitable gift for my bride?\nYou wouldn't get it. I mean, it's a reference to a classic Winston-Cece mess-around.\nBeanbag chair!\nNever in my life have I heard of a game of one-on-one Pictionary.\nWe had a moment.\nUnmoved.\nOkay.\nHad you drawn a picture poo-poo, would that have been a good gift for my Cece?\n[laughing]: It would have been hilarious.\nLook, Schmidt, I get it that you are closer to her than I am.\nUh-huh.\nHowever, I got my own thing going on with her.\nAnd I feel like you don't respect that.\nCloser to her?\nYou are.\nThat's a good way to describe our relationship, comparatively to yours.\nYeah. Yeah.\nYes, considering we are man and wife.\nYeah.\nWinston, this is a very cozy, [sighs] inoffensive blanket.\nGet it.\nHas no relevance towards our relationship.\nWhy would I do that?\nGet the blanket.\nNo.\nWinston, please.\nJust get the blanket and let's go.\nWell, since you asked nicely, no.\nJust get the blanket.\nNo. I don't want the damn blanket.\nHere's the beanbag chair.\nYeah, stores are the best.\nHey, you guys want to go get lunch or something?\nNah. How much is it?\nIt's $249.99.\nWhat? For a beanbag chair?\nFor a beanbag chair?\nWell, we have a cheaper one... we're just, we're out of stock.\nI could order it for you, but it would take seven to ten days.\nMan, stores are the worst.\nThe admiral will take this.\nWhatever happened to Hanukkah?\nHey, Jess, about that... the-the stuff I s...\nOh, wait, it's fine... I...\nI must have seemed so crazy.\nLet's just enjoy the holiday, okay?\nOkay, Secret Santa.\nBy now, the suspense must be killing you.\nAs you all know, uh, Nick knows his Secret Santa gift is Reagan flying out from Seattle to surprise him.\nAll right.\nMerry Christmas, Nick.\nAll right, Cece. That big boy's for you.\nWhat in the hell is that?\nWinston, what'd you do with the thing we just bought?\n[gasps]\nBeanbag chair!\nBeanbag chair! It's from Winston!\nWinston: They had to make it out of this dumb blanket.\nWinston, you remembered our game night. I love it.\nYou do?\nShe does.\nI do.\nWell, you know what, Winston?\nYou were right... it's the perfect gift.\nI guess I just have to come to terms with the fact that my wife is a little bit weirder than I thought she was.\nIt's a prototype, you know?\nThe real one's on its way.\nDidn't have a lot of beans, so I had to pad it with rice and oatmeal.\nIt's a great gift. Thank you.\nIt's perfect!\nGood job.\nAll right, well, whoever got Schmidt better have brought it, 'cause Winston set the bar really high.\nOh, here we go, here we go.\nHere we go. Ooh...\nOoh...\nCashmere socks! Dayanu!\n[chuckles]\nWell, it's not Winston, it's not Jess.\nCece?\nNo. No, it's not me.\nI got you, boy.\nNo way.\nI got you. This is me.\nThis is you?\nNicholas! [laughs]\nYeah, come on.\nI don't know why I'm finding the image of you mispronouncing the word \"cashmere\" in a store... to be so joyful.\n\"Cadsh-mer.\"\nWinston.\nOh.\nHa-ha! I get one?\nOh, man.\nYeah. Everybody gets one.\nThat's crazy. I get one, too.\nYou know.\nYeah, everybody does.\nAah! For me?\nOh, my stars! A check made out to my phone company?\nCece, girl, is this for that night we got bombed and called Iceland?\nYou know it is!\nOkay, hold on, wait a minute, I had... I had Winston, too.\nSomebody got left out. Who didn't get one?\nOh, Winnie got two gifts?\nThat's for Winston.\nYeah.\nOh... no, no, it's... it's fine.\nIt's... it's my fault.\nI must have gotten so tipsy on Halloween, I forgot to write down my own name.\nSee? It's right there in the song.\nHe makes a list, he checks it twice.\nSee, this is probably why Santa stopped drinking.\nWell, here, you know what?\nHave this one.\nOh, my God, a hamster?!\nYou're a pet guy, man.\nI am. I am.\nBut... Jess, you... you should have him.\nNo. I-I got the best gift of all.\nWatching you guys give each other gifts that show you care.\nWell, you can't not have a gift.\nBesides, Ferguson's gonna eat him, anyway.\nOh. Well, if... if Ferguson will eat him, then I...\nI'll take him.\nThanks, Winston.\nOf course.\nGreat Secret Santa, everyone.\nYou want to go to bed, little guy?\nYou want to see your new room?\n[sighs]\nI feel horrible.\nYou have no idea. She and I got in a thing.\nI said something so stupid.\n[door opens]\nSleigh!\nOthers: Hey, Reagan.\nHey.\nReally?\nDo you know how hard it was to put this thing on in an airplane bathroom?\nDo I.\nIf you don't get off that wheel right now, there's gonna be hell to pay.\nNow!\nWhoa. Did you understand me?\n[door opens]\nOh, you're awa... you're awake. Great.\nNick, how often do you sneak into my room in the middle of the night?\nUh, that you're awake, uh, this is a first.\nHere.\nWeird.\nHere's some cocoa.\nHey, I wanted to say that I'm sorry about what I said.\nI know you are. Thanks.\nI also want to say thank you.\nEven though I knew Reagan was coming, when I saw her I felt like it was Christmas morning and I was ten.\nBut a ten-year-old about to have sex... with Santa!\nAnd it was... yeah, this is getting weird.\nAnyway, I just wanted to say...\nI'm sorry and thank you.\n \n[purring]\nCome with me.\nUh, actually, do you want to put a bra on first?\nRobby: Cue the music.\n \nSurprise!\nSchmidt: Merry Christmas, Jess.\nCece: We got something for you.\nTa-da!\nSchmidt: Robby set it all up.\nJess [gasps]: What?!\nNick: This is for you.\n \n Christmas \n The snow's coming down \n[gasps]\n Christmas \n I'm watching it fall \n Christmas \n[laughs]\n Lots of people around \n Christmas \n Baby, please come home \nWhat is Darlene Love doing here?\nUh, we used to do hot yoga together.\nOh.\n All ringing in song \n Christmas \n What a happy sound \nThis is amazing! [laughing]\n Baby, please come home \n They're singing \"Deck the Halls\" \n But it's not like Christmas at all \n 'Cause I remember when you... \nHow much longer do I have to do this?\nI'm almost out of litter.\nIt's shredded receipts.\n[laughs]\n Christmas \nThis is the best gift.\n \nThank you.\nOthers: Merry Christmas, Jess.\nBar elves! Come on in!\n[lively chatter, ho-ho-ho'ing]\n Baby, please come home \n"}, {"title": "06x11 - Raisin's Back.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nGame time, folks.

Be cool.\n[groans]\nWinston, when she gets here, act casually.\nPretend like you didn't even know she was coming.\n[dramatic]: As I live and breathe, Raisin?!\nAh, did I say, \"Raisin\"?\nYeah.\nToo weird. Go practice in your room.\nI'm very mad at you. Go.\nWhat is happening?\nIt needs to look messier.\nHi.\nIt needs to look messy.\nYou are having a... straight up anxiety attack right now.\nNick, Nick, calm down.\nYou guys lived together in New Orleans.\nIf the old girl didn't like the dinner, she wouldn't come back for seconds.\nNew Orleans was temporary. Okay?\nReagan has never stayed in one place too long.\nIf she thinks we're making a big deal, she's gonna feel smothered.\nOkay? So you've got to do the opposite.\nIt's not a big deal.\nThat's why I didn't pick her up from the airport.\nYou didn't pick her up from the airport?\nDidn't this woman change her whole job so she can move here to be with you?\nShe is gonna be pissed.\nUh, no.\nNo.\n[whispering]: Yes, she is.\nNo, you're wrong.

You know.\nWe also send each other pictures of bears wearing backpacks and other humorous exchanges.\nWhat?\nHow about we all relax, with a nice cheese plate?

I didn't hear a thing.\nI took every precaution.\nNick [muffled]: Oh, Reagan.\n[Reagan giggling]\n[fan whirring]\nNick [muffled]: Okay, now.\n[vacuum whirring]\nThat was a good call.

Time out, time out, time out.\nI know I just did something really stupid, but why do you automatically get to be in charge of the music?\n'Cause I have the best taste.\n[Cece and Winston laughing]\nOh, no, no, babe.\nAll you like is electronica.\nIt's EDM, electronic dance music...\nYeah, here we go.\n... or what I like to refer to it as, as just \"M\"... because it's the only music.\nMusic.\nYeah, listen, Schmidt, it's trash.\nNeed I remind you that you started a petition to get Enya to play at the Super Bowl halftime show?\nYou're misrepresenting my petition.\nOkay? I wanted her to play on the field during the fourth quarter.\nSchmidt, I bet I could make a fake EDM song and you couldn't tell it apart from a real one.\n'Cause they all sound like a robot having a seizure.\nNoice.\n[chuckles] Not loving this dynamic.\nWe don't care.\nWe'll test it out.\nCece and I will make a song.\nOoh.\nAnd if we fool you, we're in charge of the music in the bar, All Enya, all up in ya.\nI'm in.\nGreat.\nHave fun looking like idiots, you morons.\nI don't really have any place to go.\nI mean, I came here to hang out with you guys, so...\nHey, you two lovebirds.\nIt's your first day of living together.\nSo, what are you doing tonight?\nI can't do anything tonight.\nI picked up an extra shift at the bar.\nNo big deal, right?\nYeah.\nIt's totally fine.\nNick: Everything's totally fine and we are good.\nOkay, well how about you? You want to go out and maybe have like a little ladies' night?\nI just feel like getting really dumb.\nYeah. Dude, I'm the dumbest.\nIt's a date. I am gonna take a seven-minute power nap and then go for a run to preempt all of this damage we're gonna do.\nI love it, I love it, I love it.\n[chuckling]: Sounds good.\nHow'd I do?\nI'm sorry. What?\nWith the whole I got to go to work and cover some shifts.\nI don't have to go to work.\nI don't have work tonight.\nI'm actually gonna go to a bowling alley and, uh, get some beers and watch people bowl.\nYou lied to Reagan, so you can watch strangers bowl?\nYeah, definitely.\nI'm trying to play it cool. I don't want to seem needy.\nAre you sure you want to start this thing off with Reagan by playing a game?\nYou know what?\nActually...\nI don't want to get involved.\n[chuckles] Do whatever you want.\nJust don't tell me about it 'cause Jess is out.\nI put a Lego in my shoe to really push myself.\nThat sounds painful.\n[laughs] Cool, cool, cool.\nHave a lot of fun tonight. Have fun. Okay?\nFun at ladies' night.\nThanks.\nLadies night!\nYou're such a lightweight.\nI feel fine.\nHell of a ladies' night, though.\nA lot of secrets came out last night, didn't they?\nSecrets?\nCece!\n[exhales] I think I really screwed up ladies' night.\nI know I reek.\n[coughs]\nPlease, please, don't gag because then I will gag.\nOkay, okay, it's really hard though, man.\nI think something terrible happened.\nReagan said, \"A lot of secrets came out last night.\"\nUh-oh, you think she knows about Nick?\nI mean, I only have one secret, so... it's got to be the Nick thing.\nIt's the Nick thing.\nThis is bad. Really bad.\nYeah, it's not good.\nAh, how could I let this happen?\n[retching]\n[gagging]\nI'm sorry, I was holding my breath the whole time.\n[retching]\n[gagging]\n[blowing]\n[coughing]\n[retching]\n[gagging]\nOh, my God. [groans]\nYou need to calm down. All right, just take a breath.\nThink of Michelle Obama.\n[sighing]: She's so strong.\nSee, it's working already.\nBesides, you don't even know what you told Reagan.\nI know she said that we have a secret between us.\nYou don't just say that.\nOkay, all right. Tell me what you remember.\nLet's just piece together what happened.\nJust the two of you?\nOh, look.\nThis bar has hooks for our purses. [chuckles]\nScore. Thank you.\nSkip to the next track.\nSplash, bitch, splash!\nI'm gonna splash you in your dumb wet face.\n[laughing] I really need to wash my hands.\nNew friend!\nNew friend!\nIs this leading to the secret?\nI don't know, Cece.\nMy brain is a smoking wreckage and I'm trying to find the black box.\nOkay, let's try to jump-start it.\nOkay? Let me try something.\nSecret!\nSecret!\nSecret!\nWhat are you doing?\nSecret!\nThis is not gonna work.\nSecret!\nIt was something about a pool.\nOh, my God, Cece.\nYou're amazing. You should work for the CIA.\nI know. Stay focused on the pool.\nI hate the way that tastes.\nIdea.\nWhat?\nLet's go to the pool.\nIs \"pool\" cocaine?\nI mean, is \"the pool,\" like, a drug thing?\n'Cause I don't \"swim.\"\nLike, I-I don't judge people who do \"swim,\" but I don't.\nNo, it's a real pool.\nAn actual pool at my apartment, my other apartment.\n[gasps]\n[whispers]: I have another apartment.\nNo, no...\nIt's a secret.\nDon't tell Nick, don't tell Nick.\nNo.\nShh.\nOh, no.\nShh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...\nOkay, well, it's time to do future Jess a solid and black the hell out.\nReagan has a secret apartment.\nA secret apartment?\nPast Jess was trying to keep me out of this.\nWhat is she, a D.C. madam?\nI have to make sure Nick never finds out about this.\nYou know what?\nI'm gonna stay out of it.\nHmm.\nClassic Jess, staying all the way out of it.\nWhen we are done with this song, Schmidt will totally think it is by Diplo or Garrix or Deadmau5.\nWhat is this?\nDon't worry about that, your mind is in a weird situation.\nFirst things first.\nI recorded a bunch of noises around the loft.\nRight?\nMm-hmm.\nSo we could use it as the hook.\nIt is the mark of any EDM song.\nOkay.\nNow, check this one out.\nNick shaving without shaving cream.\n[Nick grunting]\nHe's bleeding at this point.\nIt's good, I'm just laughing at...\nYeah, it's nasty.\n... just seeing him.\nOkay, check this one out.\nSchmidt: Haberman, my Haberman. Haberman. My Haberman. My-my-my-my Haberman.\nThis one has a pretty good rhythm to it.\nAll right, this one right here is about to set the city up topsy-turvy.\nAll right.\nFerguson... going to town on Jess's bunny slippers.\n[restrained laughter]\nIt's not... nothing.\nFerguson, you nasty.\nDid you hit the button?\nYou see, he's a gentle lover. You understand?\nThat's why you can't really hear anything, but you can feel what the slipper is feeling.\nThere's no sound.\nNo, you got to...\nHe's a...\nI can't hear anything. he's a gentle lover.\nThere's no sound in there!\nHe's a gentle lover!\nYou're just there with the phone and there's no sound.\nHello.\nYou don't understand. Oh, hey.\nYeah, it's not so easy, is it?\nCan't just snap your fingers and become a couple of Calvin Harrises-e-es.\nWinston: Listen, this is all part of our process, okay?\nSo beat it.\nYeah. Shoo.\nWe got a song to write that's gonna give you the best damn aural you have ever had.\nCheck yourself.\nOh, A-U-R-A-L.\nMmm.\nCece: For your ears.\nYeah.\nNoice.\nWell, I will see you on game day, suckas.\nOw.\nYou're not very scary.\nWe cannot let him get away with that, okay?\nWe need to dig deep, Winston.\nDo I look scared? [chuckles]\nWatch this.\n[Nick moaning]\nOh, that's just Nick eating a microwave burrito.\nNo, that actually almost works.\nReally?\nYeah.\n[Nick moaning rhythmically]\nSchmidt: Haberman.\nJess: It was something about a pool.\n[Nick moaning rhythmically]\nSchmidt: Haberman. My-my-my...\nWhat the hell is that?\nHmm? Oh, I recorded some candid audio.\nYeah, I need this track to be real.\n[Nick moaning]\nJess [echoing]: Reagan has a secret apartment.\nCece: A secret apartment?\n[Nick moaning]\nSchmidt: Haberman.\nJess: Reagan has a secret apartment.\nCece: A secret apartment?\nWait, what?\nThank you. It's missing a \"what.\"\nWhat?!\nReagan has a secret apartment?\nYou feeling it, huh?\nWinston: What?!\n[Nick moaning]\nSchmidt: Haberman. My-my-my...\nOh, oh.\n[Nick moaning]\nThat's very bad. I'm sorry, man.\nJess [echoing]: Reagan has a secret apartment.\nWinston: What?!\n[laughing]: This track is right, though.\nJess: Reagan has a secret apartment.\nCece: A secret apartment?\nSchmidt: Haberman.\nWinston: What?!\nI can't believe my girlfriend has a secret apartment!\nI'm sure there's some explanation.\nI can think of one of two things.\nOne, she's worried she's making a mistake by living with me.\nOr two, and this one is way more realistic, she has a secret family.\nOnly men have secret families.\nLook, just go talk to Reagan.\nI can't just run into the bathroom shouting, \"You have a secret apartment,\" Jess.\nShe'll bolt... to her secret apartment!\nYou talk to her.\nFind out what the deal is.\nNo way I'm getting involved.\nYou leaked the intel to Cece.\nYou're deeper than any of us.\nI was secretly recorded.\nThat is a felony, by the way.\nThis is between you and Reagan.\nJess, you've got to talk to her.\nYou've got to deal with this. She trusts you.\nPlease, you've got to help.\n\n\n\n[knocking]\nHey...\nRay Ray.\nBoo Boo?\nIs this about the apartment?\nDamn.\nJess, I know I put you in a weird spot by telling you about it.\nWhatever the explanation, it's okay.\nI don't need to know anything except, like, when did you get it, is it, like, a real, genuine place, or is it, like, a playing it cool thing, like Nick's fake bar shift?\nWhat?\nWhat?\nYou said \"fake bar shift,\" so does that mean that he didn't have to go to work, and that he lied to me?\nOh my God, you know who should talk to about this, because he could answer all your questions, is Nick.\nNo. No.\nNick!\nI don't want to talk to him...\nHey, Nick! Nick!\n.... about anything.\nOh, weird.\nI had no idea you were having a conversation [chuckling]: with Reagan right now.\nWe are in the middle of a conversation that we need to finish, so maybe we'll do that over drinks.\nDid you have other plans?\nMaybe you wanted to have a conversation with somebody.\nWell, I'd love to finish our conversation, Jess, so maybe you and I should get a drink.\nYou know what? After last night, the only drink I can handle is... room temperature milk.\nYou guys got crazy?\nDon't worry about it.\nI just really would want to be able...\nI would love to...\nNick: ... finish our conversation.\nWe started ours first, so we should finish ours earlier.\nIt's basic time science.\nIt's time science?\nYeah, it's time science.\nYou told me that you don't believe in watches or clocks, so I don't really think this is a very valid argument.\nNo, I said I believe in watches, I just don't trust who sets them.\nWho sets the time?\nYou set the time.\nWhy would I set the time? It's my watch.\nOkay, see? Talking is fun.\nWhy don't you guys continue this conversation... at the bar... by yourselves, without me?\nI'll have a milk.\nSo in front of you, you have two songs, one by a recognized EDM \"artist,\" quotes intended, the other is by me.\nCece: I also helped.\n[mocking]: Yeah, okay.\nI did!\nLay it on me.\nHere we go.\n \n[Nick grunting rhythmically]\nStop.\nWhat?\nWhat?\nYou're barely seconds in.\nThrobbing bass, the lone whistle, the gritty caw of gears grinding.\nThis is clearly the work of Tim Bergling, better known as...\nSwedish EDM demigod...\nAvicii.\nWinston: Avicii...\nAs you were.\nOh, my goodness.\nMm.\nBoo-yah.\nIt sucks to be so... damn right.\nBoo-yah!\nYeah!\nOh, oh, oh!\nThose ears heard a Bishop/Parikh original track.\nThis must be a shenanigan.\nWinston: No.\nEDM is a shenanigan.\nCorrect.\nSchmidt: My-my-my Haberman.\nHa!\nOoh!\n[music continues playing]\nYeah.\n[Nick moaning]\nSo now, it's gonna be all Enya...\nAll Enya.\n... all the time.\nCece: All the damn time, all day.\nMm!\nAmenya!\nEnya.\nHow could I have been so wrong? Have I... always had bad taste?\nWinston: Just like I said.\nYeah, I said it, too.\nHa. Okay, whatever.\nI did!\nYeah, sure. Nobody heard ya.\nIf I don't have my taste, then what's real?\nAre cargo shorts gorgeous?\nWas I wrong about rubber awareness bracelets?\nShould I grow a goatee?\nLook, Schmidt, you got fooled.\nWho cares, man?\n[chuckles]\nI care, Winston. I care.\n[exhales]\nI always thought of myself as a brand, as a lifestyle, but now... you know what, I'm gonna take back that chair, and I'm gonna get rid of all my gingham and I'm gonna... go buy a 14-pack of tube socks... at the grocery store.\nWe might have taken this one a little too far.\nYou took it too far.\nOh, now I'm involved.\n \nDo you know what I think is really great?\nThat Nick made time for us, with his very busy work schedule.\nYou know what'd be fun? If we were all just direct. [chuckles]\nJust, you know, for laughs.\nI think it's really great that we all, you know, are just kind of acting and living like one big family.\nOne big, happy, non-secret fam...\nI am too hungover to deal with this, so I'm just gonna say it.\nNick, Reagan knows that you lied about having to work.\nReagan, Nick knows about your secret apartment.\nJess!\nYou told her, Jess?\nI'm sorry, but now it's all out there, so you can talk about it.\nI can't believe you told her.\nLet's talk about how mature it is for you to pretend to not care that I switched my job and moved across the country for you.\nYou came from Seattle, pal. That's down.\nAre you a cartographer now?\nAm I a cartographer?\nYeah, did you get your Bachelor's in map science?\nThat's what a map scientist is?\nA cartographer?\nYes.\nWhy is everything a code with you? Just say map scientist.\nGuys! Let's just try being sweet to each other.\nOh, should we be sweet like a friend that spills the other friend's secrets?\nThat's a good point.\nDon't act like you didn't lie.\nYour lie was bigger.\nMy lie didn't require a credit check.\nCongratulations, Reagan. You have more apartments than I have jeans.\nSo thank God I have that apartment.\n'Cause guess where I'm sleeping tonight.\nWhere?\nIn...\n[scoffs]\n \nWell, I'll be in the honest apartment!\nYou said that a full two seconds after the door shut.\nAll right, but I still said it.\nThis is definitely one of those creepy apartment complexes for divorced dads and child actors.\n[shouts]: Reagan!\nWhat are we doing here?\nI thought your whole thing was not getting involved.\nAll I want is to not be involved, but you and Reagan are acting like complete idiots, and for friend reasons and just basic human decency, I can't walk away.\nReagan!\nMan: Quiet, please.\nI'm trying to enjoy my supermarket salad.\nReagan: Why are you guys here?\nHey.\nWhat are you doing?\nYou... you 'cuing?\nI grill.\nIt calms me down.\nThat's cool.\nJess: Okay, you guys need to start being honest, and I can't help, because this whole thing... the three of us living together... is awkward enough without me being in the middle.\nAll right? So, work it out... now.\n \nGet in here. The code is, uh... 1234#.\n[beeping, clangs]\nThat's not the code.\nIt's 1234#.\n[beeping]\nIt doesn't work.\nIt's #1234, guy.\nOh.\nYeah, that works.\nThanks, man.\nMan: Yep.\n[door closes]\nSee myself out.\nI got to say, a lot of international people living here, it's... there's good and bad in that, huh?\nI feel like we should probably... revisit that.\nWhat about your thing, Reagan?\nUh, okay.\nWell, my company rents apartments for all of their transplants.\nAnd I guess I didn't tell you about it because...\nI'm scared, and I wanted a backup plan.\nIt checks out.\nI just felt like if I came on too strong, It-it would scare you away.\nThat's why I lied.\nIt checks out.\nI didn't want you feeling, like, you know, you were trapped in some sack.\nTrapped in a sack?\nI don't want you to feel trapped in a sack.\nI wish you had used a less alarming analogy.\nYeah, women are always afraid of being trapped in sacks.\nIt's a little dark.\nMan: Will you just kiss her already, dude?\nPlease tell me you don't know this guy's name.\nI don't know the guy's name.\nThat's good. That's a positive.\n[laughter]\nMan: My name's Kevin.\n \n[door opens, closes]\nWinston: Wow.\nCowboy hat, hockey jersey, drinking from a Styrofoam cup.\nYou called it perfectly, Cece.\nCece: Pick yourself up.\nFiguratively and literally, 'cause we still haven't fumigated for weevils.\nLet the weevils take me away.\nIt was just a song. Okay?\nYour taste is your taste.\nIt doesn't matter who else likes it.\nWinston: Yeah, I mean, look at Cece, for instance.\nShe's still rocking that Planet Hollywood jacket, and that thing is ugly as hell, man.\nLike, it's a really terrible jacket, and I don't get why she wears it.\nCece: I mean, take Winston, for example.\nHe eats onions like apples.\nIt's disgusting, his breath smells bad, it makes no sense, but...\nYeah, man. I be eating them things right down to the core, man.\nYeah, and you like EDM.\n[chuckles]\nYou know what else you like?\n[door opens]\nA brand-new... fancy chair!\n[laughter]\nChair? I thought this was the base of a fish tank.\n[laughs]\nNick: Here you go, man.\nReagan: Happy birthday, Schmidt.\nIt's not his birthday.\nThen why are we doing this?\nCece: Schmidt, you love this chair, right?\nTold you to sit on it, Potsie!\nReagan: The store had free delivery.\nI don't understand what's going on.\nI know. We just do things sometimes.\nI never understood it either.\n[grunts]\nJess: Is it... comfortable?\nAbsolutely not.\nIt's a Haberman.\nPlay some music from my mobile device, that we created, you and me.\n \nCome on. You know you love it.\nLet us see it in your feet. Dance!\nHaberman.\nThere we go!\nWhoo-hoo!\n[laughter]\nHaberman.\nSchmidt: Yeah.\nYeah, feel it.\nYay!\nCece: Whoo!\nNo!\nSo, this is my life now?\nYep. Welcome home.\nY'all okay with this?\n[Nick moans]\nHaberman.\n"}, {"title": "06x12 - The Cubicle.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nTo Cece, for booking her first client's first modeling gig.\nAll: Hey!\nRobby: Cheers.\nAnd to Winston for making Donovan the face of LAPD's recruitment campaign.\nI just hope he doesn't look better in blue than I do.\nWink.\nOh, he definitely will. He's a model.\n(clears throat) So in honor of this occasion, we all got you gifts for your home office.\nYou may know it by its former name, the dining room table.\nMe first. A cubicle, swinging balls, Mm. an outgoing mailbox, a cartoon that is very derogatory towards Mondays.\nSo thoughtful, babe.\nWill that mailbox be functional?\nIf it wasn't, it would just be a box, wouldn't it?\nSo can I buy a stamp for this letter?\nIt's not a post office, man.\nWho else has a gift?\nWhoo!

Oh, my God!\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nBut wait a second, why do you want to pay?\nI turned your knee into a bag of marbles.\nI should pay your medical bill.\nThis is my only bill, and it's just a baby bill.\nYou know, it's so small and cute, like my nephew Baby Bill.\nGive me that baby.\nI feel bad, but okay.\nWait, how did you...\n(gasps)\nI studied pickpocketing when I played the Artful Dodger in my college production of Oliver!\nOh, wow, that's so cool.\nOh, wait, so did I.\nWhat...\nOw, Winston, straighten your arms when you eat.\nYou don't think I want to?\nAin't no room, fam.\nStraighten your arms, fam.\nThen how am I gonna reach my food?\nOh.\nOkay, I'm sorry, the cubicle will be gone soon, but this is a real make-or-break moment for me.\nEither I'll look back at this as my \"Steve Jobs in the garage\" phase, or that misguided month where I tried to be a manager at the dining room table.\nYou are absolutely Jobs.\nAnd I'm Woz sitting next to you the whole time in a... slightly lower chair.\n(chuckles)\nAnd speaking of jobs, by the way, you guys need to be like Winston and start getting jobs for Donovan.\nDon't you basically work on ads for a living, Schmidt?\nYeah, well, my current account is for a menopause pill that eliminates night sweats.\nOh, you're repping EstroFuel?\nYes. Chest bump.\nNick: You know, maybe I could use Donovan for the cover of The Pepperwood Chronicles.\nI mean, he wouldn't be Pepperwood but...\nGator!\nOh, Gator!\nIt's perfect.\n(laughter)\nHe could be a great Gator.\nWhy don't you just use a real gator?\nSchmidt: What?\nGator is Pepperwood's best friend... and clairvoyant brother.\nMm.\nOh, my bad.

Teachers have money.\nYou guys know how large I live. I'm flush with cash.\nI'm paying that bill.\nI'm going to the bank right now.\nI'm probably gonna take a limousine.\nTaking a limo to the bank.

There are other options.\nUm, as somebody who passed the bar exam eight years ago, I could offer you legal expertise.\nI could read the medical paperwork.\nOh! An almost lawyer and a sort of doctor.\nLucky me. Okay.\nStrategy sesh in the cubicle.\nI'll meet you guys there.\nOr we can go... all go together if you want.\nTogether.\nYeah.\nYeah, let's go together.\nGreat.\nI rewrote the EstroFuel ad to star a hunk, and I got Donovan the gig.\n(Cece laughs)\nWinston: Whoo!\nHey, everybody, Yes!\nI just want to let you know, I've thought about it, and I'm quitting modeling to focus on applying to police school.\nHoney, that is a very radical career change, okay?\nThat's why I like it. I can't be tied down.\nPicture this: your mom has night sweats.\nShe needs relief.\nLuckily, she has a handsome son to go pick up her supplements, because menopause isn't just about women anymore.\nEstroFuel: putting the men back in menopause.\nStarring Donovan.\nWow.\n(whooping)\nThat's... wow, what an opportunity.\nBut I'm becoming a cop.\nNo. No!\nYou are the face of EstroFuel.\nThe shoot is tonight.\nOh, my God, it's tonight?\nAnd I told my boss that Cece's Boys would be there.\nYou told your boss...\nThank you, I'll see you there.\nWinston, you ready for the tour?\nHmm?\nThe what?\nHuh? Yea... (chuckles)\nHere's what happened, let me explain this.\nUm, I offered Don a tour of the precinct, he accepted, and now it's happening.\n(sighs)\nOkay, Winston? Winston!\nYeah?\nYou better make sure that this is the worst tour that you've ever given anyone in your life.\nAnd that's gonna be tough.\nI've given some really bad tours.\n(sighs)\nNick: Okay, does this rendering represent the incident in question?\nThere was way more blood.\nWait, come on, it was not this violent.\nIt was way worse. Grown men fainted.\nJess, I found something.\nThe hospital billed Robby for the Larry King Preemptive Memorial Post-Op Recovery Suite.\nThat's obviously a mistake.\nUh, that's not a mistake, actually.\nI needed a private room because a lot of times in my dreams, I'm thinking about concerts that I really enjoy going to, so it's just a lot of me clapping and singing along.\n(sighs)\nI can't afford this.\nWell, you don't have to, just let me pay.\nNo, you don't pay. I pay!\nWhat if no one pays?\nFrom my drawing, I don't see any signage.\nDo you see any signage? So here's my question.\nDo you remember seeing any safety signs near the machine?\nThis is important.\nThere was just a poster saying that they were closed on Veteran's Day.\nThat's what I wanted to hear.\nFolks, we got a lawsuit. (chuckling)\nGood job.\nGreat.\nSeriously, guys, just let me pay this.\nSay that one more time.\nSay that you're gonna pay one more time and see what happens.\nWow, okay.\nYou know what usually calms me down?\nA good mall walk.\nNo, we're suing the gym.\nNick, take it away.\nWell, I would love to, but legally, I can't practice law.\nYeah, I have a really good lawyer, she's an animal.\nSo you're on board now?\nYeah, I just go with the flow.\n(phone beeps)\nI'm gonna call my gal.\nWe need the office.\nJess: What's wrong?\nYeah, so, Schmidt booked Donovan a photo shoot at Ass Strat, but Donovan just quit modeling so that he could become a cop.\n(phone ringing)\nA cop?\nIt's my boss, Kim.\n(sighing): God, I hate her.\nHello, Kimberly. You sound like your skin looks amazing.\nAll right, Reagan, you can get to reading.\nWe can stick around if you want us to.\nI don't think it's necessary.\nYou need us?\nWe'll stick around for you.\nI don't think so.\nNick: Yeah, we'll stick around.\nWinston!\nWinston!\nMe!\n\n\n\nDid you make police work look as boring as possible?\nI want so badly to tell you yes, but there was a situation.\nProtect and serve, more like protect and snooze.\n(sighing): Yeah, this is boring.\nBishop, a word.\nAnd the word is...\n\"moo.\"\nAll: Moo!\nShut up! I-I'm the C.O.W.?\nI'm the... I'm the cop of the week?\nAll:  Celebrate good times \n Moo moo \n Celebrate good times \n Moo moo \nI'm home!\nWell, congratulations, Winston, on finally making C.O.W.\nAnd damn you!\nCece, we're gonna have go put out a menopause fire.\nCece: Let's go!\nI made C.O.W., though.\nI made C.O.W., we ain't forgetting about all that.\nRobby: Okay, so, my lawyer says I don't have a case against the gym because I signed a waiver.\nA waiver? Jess, you did not say anything about a waiver.\nWas that it?\nShe didn't advise me on anything else.\nOkay. (chuckles)\nNo one says the word \"advise\" unless they got advice, so what did she advise?\nUh... oh, no.\nWhat did she advise?\nShe didn't... it just wasn't...\nWhat did she advise?\nIt didn't...\nCome on, what did she advise?\nShe advised that I sue!\nI knew it! Who?\nYou.\nMe?\nNick, can I read your book?\nI was just about to suggest it.\nNick: Let's get out of here.\nSchmidt and Cece need me.\nWhoa! God, what's that smell?\n(coughs)\nI'm not gonna sue you, Jess. Was that not clear?\nI told my lawyer that you're just an innocent bystander.\nOkay? So, if we can, uh, hit the mall?\nI mean, there is a big sale at this Japanese cereal store.\nIt sounds amazing.\nYou really think I was an innocent bystander, do you?\nIs that bad?\nYeah.\nI'm just saying that I don't really think that you, uh, ever do anything wrong.\n(laughs) Anything? Ever?\nOh, we're starting to get into this.\nLook... I know a great place where we can hash this over.\nIt's a place called Hash It Over.\nIt's in the food court at the mall, it's a hash brown...\nWe're not going to the mall.\nWhy are you watching...\nWhy am I watching you?\nWhy are you?\nI'm not anymore.\nOkay.\nWeird to watch.\nThat's why I'm not gonna do it.\nGreat.\nBye.\nI thought this was about a bill, but apparently, it's about our whole relationship.\nHow could I date someone who doesn't see me realistically?\nNo, but, Jess...\nI mess stuff up all the time.\nAsk Nick. He knows.\nNick, do I mess things up?\nYou know it, baby. Bye!\nI promised I wouldn't come back, but it is a little uncomfortable out there.\n(low snoring)\n(sighs)\nJess, I know that you have flaws.\nOkay, name one.\n(chuckles)\nUh... (clears throat) Easy.\nYou walk too fast through a museum.\nAlthough, it is pretty good, because we get to see everything and then we have time for the cafe afterwards.\nI'm gonna say that overall it enriches the experience.\nThat is just a compliment!\nI will be in the cubicle drinking myself numb.\nPlease, keep fighting.\nAppreciate it.\nKim: I am paying a top-notch photographer to sit around and bitch about how hard it is to find French cigarettes in Los Angeles.\nWhere's the model?\nChanging.\nYeah, um, uh, Donovan, are you almost ready?\nWinston: I am changing.\nI am Donovan.\nWhat agency did you use again?\nCece's Boys.\nLook... Cece herself showed up. She's very hands-on.\nThat's your wife. I've met her many times.\nSchmidt, if this falls through...\nLook, my client will be here, and if for some reason he's not, that is on me and only me.\nI'm gonna go shout into a toilet.\nOkay, well, what are we gonna do now?\nBabe, we are not gonna do anything, okay?\nYou have done so much for me, more than any normal person, and I love you.\nBut if I am gonna graduate from the dining room table, I need to learn how to manage my clients on my own.\n(sighs) Okay.\nOh, man, that was intense.\nUh, also, Schmidt, I printed something... do you know where it went?\nNot now.\nOkay.\nOkay, it's voice mail.\nDonovan...\nI know that you don't want to be tied down, okay?\nBut that's why being a model is... perfect for you.\nBecause if you're a cop, then you're just gonna be a cop.\nBut if you're a model, then you can be everyone.\nYou can be an ice cream man, a rocketeer, a jewel thief, or an underwear guy in a 10 million dollar loft whose only furniture is a telescope.\nSo, help me... help you... become the everyone that you can be!\nThat's how you do it!\nThat was awesome!\nYes! (chuckles)\nRight?\nThat was amazing.\nIt felt good.\nYou think it worked?\nCouldn't tell you.\nRobby: I know you're capable of messing up.\nReally? Because you won't even admit that the gym thing is my fault.\nYour lawyer wants you to sue me, and frankly, I agree with her.\nSo sue me.\nI am not gonna sue you.\nThen how can I ever trust you?\nThat doesn't make any sense.\nYou know what? If you're not gonna sue me, then get out of here.\nFine.\nBut I will tell you this: you will not be hearing from my lawyer.\nBye, Nick.\nNick: See you, Robby.\nI forgot you were there.\nReagan was right.\nThese noise-canceling headphones are really broken.\nI could hear everything.\nGod, why are tiny rakes so soothing?\nYou know, I think I'm finally starting to understand momentum.\nWhich, apparently, my book does not have.\nNick, everyone loves it.\nRobby wrote fan fiction for it.\nHe wrote fan fiction?\n(softly): Yeah.\nThat means the world to me.\nHe loves it so much.\nDon't take this the wrong way about Robby, but... he is way too good for you.\n(laughs)\nHe's way too good for everybody.\nI know.\nWhat is wrong with me?\n(sighs heavily)\nOh...\nAny insight, ex to ex?\nOf what's wrong with you?\nOh, this feels like a trap.\n(laughs)\nWell, you know, maybe when things are going good, you get scared and you look for reasons to doubt it.\nYeah.\nIs that what happened with us?\nI mean, I can't begin to understand what happened with us, but maybe.\nSo, what are you gonna do about Reagan?\nI don't know. Her opinion means a lot to me, so...\nWell, I think that's good you're letting yourself be vulnerable.\nWas I not that with you?\nWho knows what happened with us?\nWe were just kids. Like... you had a box, and I wanted you to get a bank account.\nWell, they're kind of the same thing.\nWell...\nYou wanted to live on a lake; I wanted to live on Mars.\nYou wanted to be a truck driver on Mars, which is impractical.\nWell, I need to work. I need to work.\nI don't want to fight with you.\nLet's not fight.\nLet's not get into the details again.\nLook, to getting older and wiser.\nAnd hopefully, a little bit better.\nCheers.\nCheers.\nAll right, time to face the music.\n(softly): Yeah.\nRelationships are so hard.\nI know.\n(sighs)\nBut we can't stay in here forever, can we?\n \nNo, we can't.\nNo, we can't.\nOkay.\n(groans)\nI'm taking the gin with me, though.\nAlcohol is kind of a cubicle for the insides.\nNick, you're like a... drunk Maya Angelou.\nNot the first time I heard that.\nCece: No, I don't want to buy your weed.\nYes, I understand how primo it is.\nWell, Donovan's mom is a dead end.\nOoh, hey, Kim. Look, it's Donovan.\n(faintly): Hey.\nThat's Winston. I know these people, Schmidt.\nI've met them, and their pictures are everywhere.\nWhy is everyone standing around?\nYes!\nDonovan!\nSorry, Winston, I can't be a cop.\nMy manager convinced me to be a model.\nWelcome to Cece's Boys, Donovan.\nOh, yes.\nKim is happy.\n(both chuckle)\nHey.\nHi.\nCool windbreaker.\nIs that new?\nYeah.\nI just went to the mall; I did a little retail therapy.\nYeah.\nLook, I'm really sorry about today.\nI shouldn't be looking for things to go wrong.\nIt's just... a thing that I do.\nI'm sorry, too.\nI mean, sometimes I act more like a... superfan than a boyfriend.\nAnd I don't want to do that with you.\nI don't want to do my thing, either.\nIt's going really well.\nEspecially considering it started with you dropping 175 pounds of iron on my face.\nSo you admit it's my fault!\nOkay, I'll admit that... it's half your fault.\nI mean, look, I could have yelled out and said \"stop\" or something, but...\nI wanted you to kiss me.\nAnd hey, I'm paying that medical bill, okay?\nBecause... I'm rich.\nOkay, fine. But I am knitting you $200,000 worth of scarves.\nFinal offer.\n(laughs)\nDeal.\nNow stand still... I'm coming in for the romantic gesture.\nOh!\nJess: Are you wearing perfume?\nI hugged a limo driver.\n(Jess laughs)\nOh, my God! Nick!\nGeez.\n(laughing): Oh, my God.\nOh... uh...\nI, uh...\nFell asleep on my book.\nIt's okay.\nAgatha Christie's husband, David... notoriously hated her writing.\nHated it.\nBut they had other things, you know?\nThey had surfing, dogs... they... they rescued a lot of dogs... had electric sex...\nI'm afraid I'm not gonna like your book.\nThank you for stopping me...\nI don't even know what I was talking about.\nI don't know anything about Agatha Christie.\nHonestly, I've never really liked fiction.\nIt puts me to sleep.\nOkay.\nThat helps, to know that.\nWhy didn't you just say that before?\nI was embarrassed, and I didn't want you to think that I'm not excited to read your book, because I am.\nI am excited.\nSo... you're excited to read my book, you just might fall asleep when you read it, but it's not personal.\nYes.\n(laughing): Okay.\n \nIt's a lot of pages.\nIt is, yeah.\nWould it help if I read some of it out loud?\nJust so you get the New Orleans flavor?\nI think it will.\n(Cajun accent): \"Julius Pepperwood loved three things in his life...\n\"his gumbo...\n\"his sex...\n\"and more of that sweet gumbo.\n(chuckles)\n\"Her legs were as long as the deep...\"\nYou have got to be kidding me!\nJust kidding.\n(laughs)\n(Cece groans)\nWhat's wrong with the house again?\nWell, I'm just worried about this one room.\nMm-hmm.\nIt feels like it's becoming... your home office.\n(gasps, laughs)\nOh, my God.\nI can't believe that you did this!\nIt's...\nIt's so amazing.\nLook at that. EstroFuel.\nAnd a... framed, shirtless picture of you.\nWell... I'm the original Cece's boy.\nOGCB fo' life.\nI love it so much, babe. I love it so much, I can't wait to start working here.\nAnd I'm gonna start working here right now.\nThis very second while there are no distractions.\nN-no d... no distractions.\nIt's perfect. Thank you. Total silence.\nIt's incredible. What a sanctuary.\nComplete silence. You got it.\nI love you. Have fun.\nYou... No distractions.\nAbort. Abort.

Check this out.\nCoach and May's foreign exchange student just added me as a friend.\nMontsie. His name is Montsie.\nI didn't know they had a foreign exchange student.\nI didn't know they moved to North Carolina.\nNeither did I.\n(they laugh)\nThey moved to North Carol... what?\nYeah.\nHow did none of us know about this? How is that possible?\nEh, they moved. It happened.\nWe need to make more of an effort.\nWe don't even know that our friend has moved to a different state.\nI mean, we're still friends.\nWe just have nothing to do with each other.\nThis doesn't bother you?\nRealistically, we'll probably see 'em two or three more times before we die.\nAnd it's sad, but it's also not that sad.\nWhat?\nWho cares? What's for dinner?\nI care.\nMcKenna, please. Please, don't do this. Okay? I mean, what about that formal swimwear ad I got you? McKenna?\nMcKen...?\nWell, guys! It happened again.\nA big agency stole another one of my clients.\nAnd I have a big audition today.\nGosh darn it. You know what?\nCece: Jess!\nThose pretty boys don't deserve you.\nWhich one is McKenna? Is he the gaunt, heroin-hot one?\nThat's Jean Francois. He got poached last week.\nMcKenna's the one that looked like a jacked Bryant Gumbel.\nOh...\nAnd this is a huge deal!\nIt's the Sausage Crunchies account!\nWhy would a dog food company be interested in a bunch of hot models?\nOh, no, it's, uh...\nNick: No, no, no.\nSausage Crunchies are people food.\nThey're like brown cheese snacks.\nYeah, it's like space food. I-I put them in soup.\nCece: I just really wanted to show this casting agency that I was legit.\nNow, if I go down there with just Donovan, I'm gonna look like a no-name hustler.\nGosh darn it.\nShould I go out now, and try to find new clients, or should I concentrate on the one client that I have left?\nYou know, they're probably sniffing around Donovan as we speak.\n(gasps) Crap.\nIs that what he wants to talk to me about?\nHe said he wanted to talk to me about something.\nIs that what he wanted to talk to me about?\nThese poachers.\nCece... Cece, calm.\nYou concentrate on Donovan.\nI'll go see if I can drum up some new clients.\nVery sweet, but the audition is in six hours from now.\nSo we have no time to look for new clients.\nWell, recruiting is just like sales, I mean selling a job is just like selling drugs. I do that every day.\nAre you offering to help, too?\nHonestly, I wasn't.\nBut based on how intensely you're staring at me, I guess I've boxed myself into a corner here, so...\nGreat! Okay. You concentrate on Donovan.\nWe'll get the models. Heads in, guys.\nWhat?\n\"Heads in\"?\nNo. It's \"hands in.\"\nI'm pretty sure it's \"heads in.\"\nWhat are we supposed to do? Smoosh our heads together?\nYeah.\nEverybody. Hands in.\nHands in.\nHands in.\nWinston: Meow.\nSchmidt: Winston!\nWhat?\nHow are you not tired of this?\nTired of what?\n \nOkay, model types, 3:00.\nTake a bow.\nWait, those two oatmeal men?\nFollow my lead.\nHow did we ever date the same dude?\n(laughs): Hey!\nKampai. That's Japanese for \"What's up?\"\nHi! Jessica Day.\nWhat are we celebrating?\nKirby here works for a marine biologist. and he got them to name a new species of sea slug after me.\nOh!\nIt's called Bruce's Eastern Sea Slug.\nYou two are fascinating.\nHave you ever considered modeling?\nKirby: I actually have. A-a lot.\nUs?\nI have a rich fantasy life.\nOh.\nI can't wait to hear more about that.\nSounds so great.\nWhat are you doing?\nThose guys are obviously not model material.\nBecause they're not cookie-cutter hot?\nCece needs a bunch of different guys, so don't judge a book by its cover.\nExcept when you're talking about models.\nModels exist to be on covers.\nI think that's an oversimplification.\nI think the best models have something to give them a little personality.\nSomething, something that makes them stand apart.\nLike a gap in their lower teeth, or a neck nipple.\nYou're making this way too complicated.\nLook, this is all it needs to be... you walk up to a hot guy, okay?\nAnd you say \"Hey, you're hot.\n\"Do you want to be a model?\"\nYou have to forge a connection with them.\nAnd that way they entrust us with the thing that makes them really beautiful.\nYou know what? You do your thing.\nI'll do my thing.\nBut your thing cannot be going back to the slug guys.\nSea slugs, Reagan.\nThey're sea slug guys.\nBut you're right.\nYou're nasty about it, but you're right.\nCece: So, Donovan, you have something you want to tell me?\n(inhales, exhales)\nI've... made a big decision.\nNo, Donovan, don't.\nI'm gonna stop wearing beanies.\nWait, what?\nI think. I...\nThat's what you wanted to talk to me about?\nI thought some big agency was trying to poach you.\nNo. (chuckles)\nThey've just been sending me baskets and trying to take me to fancy dinners and stuff.\nWhat?\nThey've just been giving me baskets and trying...\nListen to me, okay?\nI know that gift baskets are great.\nYeah.\nThey are.\nBut once BGE signs you, there are no more baskets.\nBecause they don't care about you.\nAll they care about are numbers.\nBut you, Donovan, you are my first priority.\nSo when you're with me, you will never feel neglected.\nJust tell me what you need. I got you.\nI need someone to help me get better at tricks on my motorcycle.\nSure.\n(grunts) Mmm.\nI really hate these things. I just can't stop eating 'em.\nI got to say, the taste is average, but the aftertaste is outstanding.\nWhat happens when I'm just an outstanding aftertaste?\nHmm?\nWhen I move out, are you guys gonna forget about me like Coach?\nThis loft is what tethers us together.\nAnd once it's gone, we're gonna be spread across the Earth like Rod Stewart's offspring.\nWhat I'm gonna miss most about you is all this poetry.\nNo, no, no. You know what, do not give up on us already.\nWe just need to find something that keeps us together.\nLike a dark secret or a time-share.\nYou know, it was easier when men went to war.\nYou'd forge an unbreakable bond in a crucible of blood and pain.\nYou can't get that splitting the cost of toilet paper.\nWe just need to come up with some sort of ritual.\nYes! Now you're thinking.\nWe stand in a circle, right?\nWe burn chicken bones, all right?\nDear Lord, Winston.\nThen we're just secretive about it.\nThis is the wrong ritual...\nI'm just saying no one knows about it.\nI didn't literally mean a ritual.\nOh.\nI just mean, like, a shared experience, one that bonds us together.\nI've been saying this for the longest time, but I'm really ready to get super weird into metal detectors if you guys are.\nThat's, sure, that's one idea.\nYou can look for treasure.\nNickels, dimes, quarters.\nIf you find enough, um, said treasure or change, supplement your income.\nIt's also entertaining.\nWhile looking, there's, uh, an endorphin rush.\nIt's entertainment, it's income... uh, ritual.\nWhy don't we get tracksuits and play chess at the park?\nI already got a chess crew.\n \nYou do that right outside of the loft?\nYeah, right outside the loft.\nHow have I never seen you once?\n'Cause you don't go outside of the loft.\nThat's just not true.\nFellas, fellas, fellas, I got it.\nYeah? Metal detectors?\nThat's a super cool idea, man.\nI appreciate the idea. I want to hear more about it.\nI feel like I'm being teased.\nLet me guess, you guys are pre-gaming before your high school reunion.\nYou were nerds, but you grew up to be super handsome.\nYou were cool but approachable.\nMaybe you were rollerbladers...\nOkay. Here's the deal.\nYou're all models now, and that's your new manager.\nH-hold on a sec. There's only one number on this card, and there's two of you.\nOh. (laughs)\nYou think we're trying to pick you up, because we're at a bar and we're telling you how handsome you are.\nExcuse me.\nYou're hot, and you're about to make the easiest decision of your life.\nNot interested.\n He's a brown-eyed handsome man \nDon't tell me. Only child, right?\nI guess now I am.\nAs of yesterday.\nSorry, did you... did you...\nIt's loud. Did you hear what I, I said?\nI said you were hot.\nUm, have you ever thought about modeling?\nLady, you can't treat me like a piece of meat.\nNow, I know I'm hot, but I don't need your validation.\nWe're trying to have a serious conversation here about why the bees have disappeared.\n He hit a high fly into the stands \nIf a couple of guys in a bar can't figure it out, who will?\n He was headed for home \n It was a brown-eyed handsome man \n They won the game, it was a brown-eyed handsome man \n They won the game \n It was a brown-eyed handsome man. \nSo, how'd you do?\nGot a couple irons in the fire, so...\nMe, too, me, too. Planted a couple seeds, just waiting for the harvest.\nHey! Hey, you.\nStop what you're doing right now.\nWhat? I'm sorry.\nThat's just how I walk.\nIf I don't swing my arms, I start thinking I'm standing, and I'll fall.\nOh... (chuckles)\nTell me, do you have any modeling experience?\nI was trapped in a window display in a department store once, and I was on the news a lot.\nAre we talking local or national news?\nOh, that's a good question.\nUm...\nI think... sorry... what my friend is trying to say is that it sounds like you have on-camera experience, and if you would like, we can hook you up with a top talent manager who could get you an audition today.\nI do like hooking my thumb into my belt loops, and pulling my pants down...\nYeah. No. Don't do it now.\nBut it is called \"The Cowboy.\"\nAnd I can see it's not your first rodeo.\nOkay. Uh, your new manager's name is Cece.\nGo to that address.\nThanks. Okay.\nNo, don't say it.\nWe're a team.\nNo.\nI'm the bait, you're the hook.\nI don't think the bait usually thinks of the hook as its teammate.\nThat's such a hook thing to say.\nYou're such a hook.\nYou know...\nI've always wanted to have a boys spa day.\nNick, did you wear your shirt during the massage?\nI did, but no bottoms.\nIt was liberating.\nGood for you.\nCheck this out. These cucumbers are gratis.\n(laughs) I'm gonna make some pickles.\nIf you're impressed by a couple of free cucumbers, get ready to have your blind blown, 'cause I signed us up for the elite package.\nDoes that mean the pickle's already pickled?\nGentlemen, eucalyptus towels?\nThank you.\nOh, yeah... uh, mine's already wet!\nNo, no, no, it's for smelling, not drying.\nOh.\nPut it up to your face, smell it.\nMmm. How could a smell be both hot and cold at the same time, I ask.\nIt's nice.\nOoh, this place is dope.\nMan, I feel very Roman.\nBoys, I think we found our ritual.\n(laughing) Yeah, we did.\nIf you gentlemen are ready, I can take you to your Brazilians.\n(laughs) Sounds very fun.\nI'm in a relationship, myself.\nYeah.\nUh, but I would love to look.\nJust point me to the door, please.\nSir. The elite package at S'Pa includes the wax removal of hair from your nether regions.\nWhat did you say, homeboy?\nScrotum wax.\nNo, Schmidt.\nSay something.\nSay something to him.\n\n\n\nCece: Donovan.\nI have some very good news.\nI have a brand-new client that I am very excited for you to meet.\nI'm Dean and I'm a model.\nMm-hmm.\nBut I'm a model.\nNo. I'm a model.\nYeah, both models.\nNo. I'm a model.\nNo. I-I am a model.\nI am... I'm the model.\nBut, like, I'm, but I model.\nI'm a model.\nI model.\nYou...\nI'm a model.\nI just told... I'm a model.\nAstro Fuel.\nI model.\nWhat the heck is going on?\nWell, Cece's Boys is growing, so I'm just gonna help Dean make a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for the big audition we're all gonna go on.\nWhat about my r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\nYou already have a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nWell, I-I-I want another one.\nAnd another sandwich.\nI want a sandwich, too.\nStop copying me!\nDonovan. Dean.\nReagan: Um...\nHmm.\n(indistinct chatter)\nNo...\nThe line between what we're doing and being creepy is so thin.\n(cell phone rings)\nHey, Cece, what's up?\nAny luck? The audition's in an hour, I'm getting kind of panicky.\nYeah. Totally. Um... we're just looking for that perfect Cece's Boys type, you know... perfect.\nOw!\nI don't know hair this short can get so tangled!\nOkay?\nYou're hurting me.\nI'm very sorry.\nDonovan: Cece, I don't know how many buttons to do on my shirt.\nDonovan, please.\nLook, Jess.\nIf you haven't found anyone by now, maybe I should just cut my losses.\nMaybe I should just tell them I only...\nNo, no, no, no, no. We actually, um...\n(clears throat) we have two guys, we'll...\nYou do? Oh!\n... bring them right over.\nYou are the best. Thank you!\nI'm sorry?\nI'm gonna be honest.\nI don't know what I'm looking for.\nOh, it-it's the other one.\nNo.\nThey have a real look.\nWhat look would that be?\nI own my own dog-walking company?\nBranding!\nYou're good.\nYou know what? I believe in them.\nAnd we also have no other choice.\nSo let's get them camera-ready.\nHow far away is that camera gonna be?\n(laughs)\nOkay, guys, let's go... Oh, hey, Kirby.\nLooking good.\nThat is for cats.\nBut it's okay. Put this on.\nThey're from my roommate's earthquake kit.\nHe has a three-week supply.\nBruce. Put this on. They won't recognize you on your next volunteer shift at the hospital.\nAh. Jess.\nHallway.\nOkay, are you absolutely sure that this is the way to go?\nCan't we get our hands on, like, a water polo team?\nOr hire escorts?\nOr call in a bomb threat to the audition.\nIn this political environment?\nOh, I'm nervous even saying it.\nWhat about nothing?\nNo!\nIs nothing maybe the right thing to do in this situation?\nWe can't bail on Cece. This is her shot.\nWe can't let her become irrelevant like chunky belts, or quoting Borat.\nOkay. Well, if I have to go down with the ship, I'm not going down without a fight.\nAnd those two are gonna need a lot more than hair gel and V-necks.\nThey're gonna need motorcycle boots, scarves, knit caps, and all the eye makeup that Schmidt's got.\nDean (muffled): Cece?\nHello?\nCece?\n(muttering)\nWhat are you doing in here?\nDonovan told me to wait here in your break room and then he left.\nWhat?!\nAnd I couldn't open the door and it was really dark.\nDonovan, get in here right now!\nDonovan, we have an audition in an hour and you lock Dean in a closet?\nWell, you said I was your number one client.\nOkay. No. Wait, Donovan.\nI'm out of here.\nJust calm down. Wait.\nI went the wrong way. Don't look.\n(whispering): So, what are we thinking?\nI don't know. Maybe they give you something to bite down on.\nNo, I'm talking about leaving!\nYou're being so dramatic right now.\nI don't think I'm being dramatic.\nLook, I'll say it now without any drama.\nI don't want the hairs ripped off my testicles by a stranger.\nI think they're there for a reason.\nThey are trained professionals in there.\nThis isn't gonna be some back-alley sack waxing.\nThey have those?\nI'm sure they do, but this isn't one of them.\nWho would go to that one?\n(sputters) Well, sometimes, in an emergency, you got to do what you got to do.\nWhat would the emergency ever be?\nNick, this is gonna be like cottage cheese all over again.\nAt first, you're gonna be kicking and screaming, saying that you don't want to try it, but I'm telling you, in the end, you're gonna tell everybody that you meet how much you loved it.\nThis is nothing like cottage cheese.\nExactly like cottage cheese.\nGuys, I have off-the-charts follicle strength, okay?\nIt'll be a blood bath down there, a real crime scene, so I'm leaning, \"No.\"\nI'm out! Like my mother says at every party she goes to, \"No one touches my purse.\"\nGood day.\nWait. Sit. Sit down.\nYou guys don't need to leave.\nJust a minute ago, you were saying how much you love this place.\nJust don't get your sack waxed.\nOkay, I don't care how big the park is.\nIf there is a loose bear in it, I'm not going in the park!\nI'm never going in that park again!\nI'm never going in again!\nBut this is our ritual!\nSchmidt, we'll just find a new one.\nEasy for you to say.\nYou two guys are still gonna be living together in the loft, saying, \"Oh, oh, I'm sorry.\n\"I didn't know you were in here in the bathroom.\"\nAnd coming up with clever names for the Wi-Fi network like, \"This Is 4D.\"\nThat's pretty good.\nI'd say we just... let's agree right now to switch it to that.\nPoints is, is your lives are going to go on, and I'll just always be that weirdo you once lived with.\nSo you know what?\nI am gonna get my sack waxed.\nSo enjoy the rest of your lives together.\nI'm gonna go shuck this corn.\nOh, man.\nHey, do you think they'll take a picture of him just as they rip like they do on roller coasters?\nI think you missed the point of what just happened.\n(laughing)\nDid you just see that?\nNo. I had my eyes closed.\nI was saying a non-denominational prayer for Bruce and Kirby. What did I miss?\nThat woman just checked out our guys.\nLike, she-she really checked them out.\nMaybe we have a chance. I don't know.\nDid you hear what you just said?\nWhat?\nYou said, \"Our guys.\"\nOkay, let's just go in.\nOur guys!\nDon't get sentimental.\nOur guys.\nOh, you get off of me.\nOur guys!\n(indistinct chatter)\nJess, I asked for models, not a couple of driver's ed instructors!\nI know, Cece, but they're hot on the inside.\nBruce teaches CPR to children with irregular mouths, and Kirby has given so much bone marrow, they told him to stop.\nI don't know how that's gonna help them at a print ad audition.\nYou're right, she's right.\nI don't know what we were thinking.\nLet's go put these dogs down.\nWhy did we even give them names?\nThey came with names.\nRight, I guess what I meant is why did we bothering learning them.\nGuys, uh, there's been a little hiccup.\nWe're allowed to eat all these, right?\nI just love them.\nYeah, you guys can keep eating. Um, so, there's no way to sugarcoat this, but the truth is...\n(shushing)\nWait, wait, wait...\nSo gross, right?\nOoh, nasty!\n(shushing) Cece? Cece, come here.\nWhat?\nLook around this room.\nNobody's eating these things but them.\nOh, my God, yes!\nAnd they love them.\nIt almost makes me want to try them.\nAnd I emphasize \"almost.\"\nThey're making a mistake.\nThese are the guys that can sell this stuff.\nNot these guys.\nBut they've already decided on the direction of the ad.\nSo tell them to change it!\nI mean, what have you got to lose?\nHey, Joy.\nI'm scared.\nNick: Don't you be scared, kid!\nNick?\nWe're here with you, buddy!\nWinston!\nNick: We don't need a ritual, Schmidt, 'cause you're not gonna lose us.\nI thought we could've just told you that, but Winston thought we needed to show it.\nYeah, I thought that would be better.\nYou know, it makes more sense to me.\nBand of brothers.\nBand of brothers!\nThat's right, man. Band of brothers, bro.\nBand of brothers.\nYou know, I've been a little bit curious about it this whole time.\nI just couldn't admit it to you guys, you know?\nI think this would be more dignified if we did it in silence.\nSchmidt: Of course.\nYeah, let's do this in silence.\nGood luck, guys.\nI'm ready for you, lady.\nThree friends going on the same silent journey, together, yet separate, alone, yet closer than ever.\n(screaming)\nNick?\nI'm all right!\n(paper ripping, Winston screaming)\nSchmidt: Winston?\nCan you hear me, Schmidt?!\nYou hang in there, you son of a... (screaming)\nAah! This woman's ripping it off!\n(shrieking)\nOoh! That's actually kind of warm. Ouch!\nNo!

You both are here.\nSo, guess who got the Sausage Crunchies job.\n(gasps) Oh, yay, Kirby!\nHey, Kirby!\nNot Kirby, but I am going to hang on to him.\nI think he could book ads for both fast food and anti-depressants.\nAh.\nBruce?\nThey absolutely hated Bruce.\nHe got sick during the audition.\nSausage Crunchies everywhere.\nThat's a lot.\nBut they loved Dean!\nMm. (laughs)\nOh, it's nice to see the good guys win.\nRight?! They said I brought them the best and the worst of the day, so... maybe that's my thing.\nHmm.\nCan I throw out this, uh, soggy bag of cucumbers?\nWinston: No!\nThose are pickles in progress.\n(groaning)\nUm, I don't mean to be mean, but you guys are being real babies about this whole thing.\n(laughs) They don't...\nUntil you've had your sack waxed, you can't know this pain.\nExcuse me?\nChildbirth?\nWeekly wax, top to tail.\nWe went through hell, and we came out the other side, gentlemen.\nIt was war.\nGranted, one that took place in a high end-spa, but still our war.\n(laughs)\nThat's right.\nI mean, this not something we do every week, right?\nNo, it's like a monthly thing.\nMonthly?\nNot a chance!\nIt's our ritual.\nNo. No, no, no, no. One time only.\nGuys, how can it be a ritual if we only do it one time?\nShut up, Schmidt! I will never go back!\n(Winston crying)\nNick: It's okay, man.

(laughs)\nLefty?\nLefty?\nYeah, she's left-footed.\nI'm throwing Aly a surprise welcome-home dinner.\nI invited her whole family here, you know.\nUh, I wanted her to see all the people she loves, which becomes love for me, you know, and the next thing you know, I'm getting one of those \"best boyfriend ever\" mugs, which you can buy, I just don't want to do all that.\nI want to... I want to earn it.\nYou're inviting them over here?\nYeah.\nWinston, this place is a hellhole.\nLook at this.

End of story.\nThat's amazing.\nI think we can come up with better ones, don't you?\nNo, that's a home run for sure, because I woke up wet.\nNow I see.\nAnd also, it's all about how you tell it.\nRight.\nI trust you.

Just...\nI'm really hungry.\nHere.\nYou can have some of my trail mix.\nThat's just a bag of raisins.\nWell, that's because I only like to eat the peanuts and the chocolate.\nWell, I only like the chocolate and the peanuts, too!\nWhy do we even add raisins?!\nI don't know!\nAll right, look, you know what, we're lost and... it's gonna get dark soon, so let's... just head back.\nFine. Did you pack a flashlight?\nRobby, did you pack a flashlight?\nNo.\nThen there's your answer.\nYou know what, it's fine, okay?\nWe know that we have to go downhill, so just follow me.\nI'll lead, okay?\nAh!

Boil it up!\nRobby: Okay, well, it's really dark and uneven, but at least we found the trail.\nYeah, I mean, it's like a night hike. (chuckles)\nMaybe we'll see a colony of bats. (chuckles)\nIt's kind of like a waterfall.\nBut with monsters, in the sky.\n(thunder cracks)\nOh! Oh, man.\nOkay, uh, Jess, it's raining.\nJess: Let's take shelter in that cave!\nWhat if it's more of a nest than a cave?\nWhatever. It'll do.\nSister!\n(both squealing)\n(chuckles)\nWinston: Oh, that's some sisterly love right there.\nLet me get you two a drink.\nOkay.\n(squeals)\nOh, my God, Winston is so good for you.\nWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\nAnd I saw with my own eyes one day when Winston saved those kids from a burning building, including a little boy.\nA little boy who's dad left when he was young.\nNamed Wheelchair Timmy.\nWheelchair Timmy was a heavyset boy, ginger.\nBlack eyes.\nSo what, you think I'm just some cold robot who needs some guy to loosen me up, make me happy?\nI just said Winston's good for you.\nOh, my God, you always get like this!\nHe grabs the kid and the chair, lifts him up above his head, so that the fire doesn't burn this little heavyset boy.\nThat's the power of adrenaline.\nAnd what happened to Timmy?\nTimmy? He's dead.\nWhat?\nHe's alive. I'm Timmy.\nLook at me now.\nBecause of Winston, I'm telling you this story.\nNo, you said your name was Nick.\nI am Nick. I got to go!\nHow should I be, huh? Like you?\n(mocking): \"Oh, my God, look at me, I'm Leslie. I wear holiday socks in the summer. I follow Ariana Grande around like she was the Grateful Dead.\"\n(mocking): \"Oh, I'm Aly.

Women's watches.\nHow'd you know that?\n Wallingford watches \nBoth:  'Cause the time is now \n And the look is wow! \n(chuckles)\nRobby...\nI think we're related.\n(thunder rumbles)\n(Jess and Robby screaming)\n(Jess and Robby screaming)\nDo you have an Uncle Tony?\nTony, with the long fingernails, and he always wears a whistle around his neck.\nRobby, we are third cousins.\nOh, my God!\nAh!\nWhy, God?!\nWe're going to hell!\n(groans)\nWe did stuff.\nNo, stop!\nJust saying.\nI can't live in this reality!\nAt least not second cousins.\nAh, I can't.\nFirst cousins would be way worse.\nPlease, no.\nPeople do it all the time, in the, in the mountains.\nIn the mountains.\n(retches)\nDon't be startled.\nGod!\nWhat are you doing in here, Cece?\nI am hiding, okay?\nThat party is out of control.\nSome guy almost burned his eyebrows off trying to light a cigarette on our stove.\nIt's complete anarchy in there.\nCan we just hide in here and hang out together?\nWe haven't christened the garage yet.\nOoh, you make a very good point.\nOkay.\nWinston: Hey.\nHello, Winston.\nHey.\nQuestion: have you guys seen Aly?\n(sighs)\nWhat's going on, man?\nShe ran off. If I'd known it was gonna be like this, I would've just done the trench coat thing.\nThe... what?\nWhat is the trench coat thing?\nIt's where I pick her up from the airport naked, wearing nothing but a trench coat.\nHave you guys seen a kid in a wheelchair?\nThat was me.\nWhat?\nWhoa!\nWow.\nNick, what are you doing in here?\nLook, I was having a hard time with your stories, so I took a little poetic license.\nPeople started asking some questions.\nThings got ahead of me.\nAnd I had no choice but to hide in the car.\nNick, I thought you were gonna stick to the tub story.\nIt's not a story, Winston. It's not a story!\nA story about sleeping...\nIt's mental.\nIt's really not...\nHey.\nFound her.\nYeah.\nHey, are you guys ever not together?\nRarely.\nYou know what? Hold on one second.\nI want to talk to you. Guys, can you give us a minute?\nSure, Winston. Cece, let's go hide in the car... in the garage of our home.\nYeah, okay.\nWe'll give you guys a minute.\nAly, uh, I was just trying to be sweet and...\nAnd I ruined it. I know.\nI said my family was crazy, and I ended up being the craziest one.\nLook, I'm so embarrassed you saw that side of me, and I'm sure you want to run for the hills.\nSo, it's fine. I don't blame you.\nYou're embarrassed of being crazy in front of me?\nI acted insane.\nEven just talking about it is humiliating.\nI'm just gonna, yeah, I'm gonna walk away.\nOkay.\nOh, dear Lord.\nThe car's running.\nNick, how long have you been in here?\nBeen running this whole time?\nI was cold. I was cold.\nDid you ever go to one of those big Wallingford family cookouts?\nJust one, in '92.\nI remember they had a really competitive three-legged race, and they paired me up with a little boy who had a helmet on.\nHis skin was so translucent, it was like he was a jellyfish.\nDid he play an imaginary trombone?\nYeah.\nHe kept saying, \"It's better to be safe than speedy.\"\nThat was me! That was me!\nOh, my God.\nOh, this is too much.\nI don't want to die with my cousin-lover in a cave.\nOh, God.\nEveryone will think we fled here 'cause society wouldn't accept us.\nI just wanted to see a waterfall.\nMe, too! I got to get out of here!\nYou can't walk, I can't see anything.\nStand up, blind boy. I'm getting on your back.\nTake these.\nOh, okay.\nOh, man. Okay.\nWe have the same prescription.\nYeah, no kidding, Robby. All right, you ready?\nYeah. So, \"Wallingfords\" on three?\nNo! Ew!\nI'm really sorry. I'm so nervous.\nOkay, one, two, three!\nTwo, three!\n(both yelling)\nRobby: I didn't wear the right shoes for this!\nJess: Go over there!\nI'm sorry about before.\nI guess I really freaked out on you.\nAnd I'm sorry that I told you I was gonna shave your eyebrows off in your sleep.\nYou never said that.\nOh, maybe I was just thinking that.\nI'm just so embarrassed Winston saw that.\nI'm pretty sure I scared him off.\nNo, you didn't. He's on the table.\n(tapping glass)\nOh, no.\nOh, no, no, no.\nWinston: Hello.\nI am Winston Bishop.\nI'm Aly's boyfriend.\nPlease, if you will, I want to, uh, say a few words to my girlfriend.\nHe's standing on the furniture.\nJust relax, okay? Help is on the way.\nAly, I wanted you to feel special tonight because... I'm wild about you.\nMaybe things didn't go perfectly, but damn it, don't be embarrassed to be crazy in front of me.\nOkay? I am the king of crazy.\n(chuckles)\nI have inside jokes with my cat.\nI am a member of the Puzzling Guild of North America.\nI shave my face cold, and I brush my teeth hot.\nIt's true.\nOn one very late and very desperate night, I used Furguson's cat box as my own box.\nAnd, yes, it is true what many of you have heard.\nI once fell asleep in a bathtub!\n(laughing)\nI love that story.\n(continues laughing)\nAnd then what happened?\nWhat do you mean, \"And then what happened?\"\nHe fell asleep in the tub!\nHe was asleep, and then he woke up.\n(stomping on table)\nI don't know, maybe I got to hear it again.\nSo who cares if you're crazy?\nI don't care. I'm crazy, too.\n(scoffs) Watch this.\nI'm gonna put a carrot behind my ear, like a bunny reporter, and I'm gonna do this dance I've been working on for five years.\n(grunting rhythmically)\nDon't you do that carrot.\nLittle bunny carrot.\n(imitates chewing)\n(Winston mumbling goofy noises)\n(laughs)\nI see we got two new... people here.\nWho are they?\nYeah, um, Mom, Dad, this is Winston.\nHey.\n(chuckles)\nUh... I am Winston.\nAnd I assure you that all of those incidents were from a very long time ago, kinda.\nIt's clear you love our daughter.\nIn a very passionate, unique way.\nThat's all that matters.\n(chuckles)\n(mouthing)\nYou're a two-hander, huh?\n(laughs)\nWell, all right.\nOkay.\nYes.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSeriously, we've been on the road for a couple of hours.\nWe need to use the bathroom.\nYeah, yeah, yeah, of course!\nIt's, uh, right down, right down the hall.\n(chuckles)\nThank you for not being afraid of me or my family.\n(knocking)\nOpen up. Police!\nWho-who called the police?\nI don't know.\nI guess we better do whatever they say. Ugh.\nWhy are you guys acting like you're in a porno?\n(sighs)\nWe got a noise complaint.\nThe law has spoken, everyone.\nI guess the party's over.\nYou could just file out through here.\nWinston?\n(chuckles): Look who it is.\nHey, Aly, you're back.\nJenkins, get in here, man! We having a party.\nWhat you drinking?\nHi, Jenkins.\nWait, what?\n(laughs)\nWell, you know what, I guess I'm just gonna have to take the law into my own hands.\nAll right, everybody!\nShoes off, coasters down!\nThis is our house, and our house has rules! Okay?\nNot a suggestion. Shoes off, let's go!\nOkay, okay. Shoes off.\nShoes.\nSchmidt: Take your shoes off...\nGet 'em off!\n... and put 'em to the side!\nYep!\nAnd then let's have a good time.\nYeah, let's have some fun.\nIt's a party, people.\nIt's a party.\nRobby: So just to be clear, um, we're definitely broken up, right?\nYeah.\nYeah, I mean, that's...\nYeah.

They look great on you.\nThank you.\nI'll see you around.\nYeah.\nMaybe at the next family reun...\nToo soon. Yep.\nA little too soon. Yes.\nOh, dear Lord.\nIt's not as bad as it looks.\nI'm really, I'm really clean underneath all this mud.\nOh, my God, what happened?\n(sighs) Hike took a turn, and then Robby and I broke up in a cave.\nI'm so sorry, sweetheart. I am so sorry.\nAir hug.\nYeah.\nI'm gonna go get you a glass of wine.\nReal sorry about you and Robby. Don't touch anything.\nI'm gonna go get some paper towels. Don't-don't move.\nWhoa, Jess! Are you okay?\nOh, long story.\nBut I'm okay. Is there any food left?\nI'm so hungry, and all I have is this bag of gross raisins.\nGross raisins? Are you kidding me?\nRaisins are the best. I love raisins.\n(laughs): Of course you do.\nYeah, sometimes I just tuck 'em in my cheek, and I go about my day, so if I ever need the flavor of raisins, well, I already got it.\nI'm having trouble envisioning what it's like to need the flavor of raisins.\nBut go nuts.\nGo raisins. (laughs)\nYou said, \"Go nuts,\" I said, \"Go raisins.\"\nCece: Wine.\nPaper towels.\nJess: Oh, thank you, Schmidt.\nThanks. Oh, thanks.\nThanks. Thank you.\nSchmidt: Just step on these.\nNick: Go faster.\nJess: Uh, I have enough paper towels.\nWinston: Hey!\nJess: Hey!\nHey, what's up?\nNot much.\nWelcome to the party.\nThanks.\nWhere's Robby?\nJess: Oh, yeah, um, he couldn't make it.\nTurns out we're cousins, so...\nNick: What?!\nCece: What?\nNick: He's your cousin?\nJess: House looks great.\nNick: Wait a second.\nThank you.\nWhat?\nHow did that happen?\nNick: Cousin?\n"}, {"title": "06x15 - Glue.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWell, this is the last of Robby's stuff.\nHow you doing with the breakup?\nReally well, since we're related, and all the laws of nature say we should not be together.\nIf you guys need me today, I'll be in my room rearranging my furniture so it no longer resembles a place where I made out with my cousin.\n(all groaning)\nThird cousin.\nStill.\nUgh, barely better.\nEw.\nDon't normalize it, Jess.\nUgh.\nYou're right, you're right.\nUgh.\nHey, Nick.\nAre you wearing your running bottoms and your hoodie?\nNick, are you going running?\nHave fun.\nOh, my God. What is wrong with Nick, Reagan?\nYeah, what happened? Are you guys okay?\nNick is going for a run. (chuckles)\nIf anything, we should be asking what is right with Nick.\nHe only goes running if he's upset.\nAnd he's wearing his sad hoodie.\nAnd by the looks of it, it's been washed, which is bone-chilling.\nHe's fine. Everything's okay.\nI just passed Nick on the street running, on purpose!\nOh, my God!\nMaybe I was wrong.\nNick!

(chuckles)\nNick is just an enigma wrapped up in a bunch of Chicago Bears crap.\nYou need the help of a seasoned vet.\n(knocking at door)\nCome in!\nHey, Nick.\nHey.\nYou feeling upset about something?\nNo. I'm just eating edamame.\nGive me the cup. (spits)\nThey taste so bad.\nThat's what I thought.\nI submitted The Pepperwood Chronicles to a publishing company, and I got the rejection letter today.\nMy career is over.\nNo, it's not.\nNick, someday you'll be talking to a reanimated Oprah about that book.\nHave you talked to Reagan about this?\nI bet she'd be awesome to talk to.\nNo, I am too embarrassed.\nNick, she's your girlfriend. You have to let her in.\nDon't just keep her in the perfect front room.\nOkay.\nLet her in the back, with the weird rooms and the-the dead bulbs and the wet walls.\nAll right, but I'm not letting her go anywhere near my crawl space.\nI don't think you should let anyone near your crawl space.\nWell, some people have to go to the crawl space to clean out the boxes.\nWho cleans out the boxes?\nSignificant other.\nWhat are you talking about?\nHey. I have the scoop.\nNick's book got rejected, and he's really embarrassed.\nSo now the baton...\n has been passed... \n... to you.\nYou own an actual baton?\nIt was Robby's.\nHe was really into competitive male twirling.\nI have so many questions...\nNo.\nWinston: First, thank you for coming to this very special event.\nMight I just add that everyone looks fresh.\nNow, when Aly gets here, I am going to suggest an activity for the four of us to do.\nThen I'll gracefully back out, leaving the two of you to distract her, as I prepare for... the show.\n(giggling)\nOoh, I got a scream and nowhere to put it.\nOoh, this is exciting.\nNow, at an undisclosed time, I will place a call to Aly, informing her that my car has broken down in Malibu, where I'll be waiting with a beautiful and glorious picnic right next to her favorite plant...  the common cactus.\nHere comes that scream. Oh, my God, there she is.\nOh, I'm screaming already. Aly!\nHey.\nHey, hey.\nHey, hey.\nHi.\n(giggling)\n(chuckles)\nStrange energy, guys.\n(giggling continues)\nWe all had bubbly water. It made us giggle.\nWhat's up? What's up? What's up?\nHi. Hello.\nWhat's up?\nHi. Hello.\nHello.\nAnyway, uh, Schmidt and Cece asked us to help paint their house.\nPaint our house?\nPaint the house.\nRemember? That's the activity for all of us to do.\nYou know, 'cause you wanted... you wanted...\nPaint the house. Paint the house. Yes, we... did.\nEven though the majority of our house is already painted.\nWe wanted our best friends to finish it.\nNot professionals.\nLike, uh... like our new home was some tree house in a Little League baseball movie.\nI mean, I-I've never done it before, but...\nSounds like a yes to me.\nAw, snap, just remembered, I can't make it.\nUh, uh, boo.\nUh... (exhales)\nYeah.\nBoy, that's a bummer.\nShock. So fast.\nShoot.\nUgh.\nBut, you know, boo.\nWhat up, boy in the hood?\nI thought you were gonna talk to Reagan.\nI tried, but she's been on her phone all day like a grandpa who missed a package.\nLike... \"Hel...\"\nI'm not even gonna do it.\nYes. Thank you so much. We will be there. Thanks.\nNick, I know that dumb publisher rejected your book.\nAnd, guess what, that publisher can go to hell.\nAfter you beat them to death with this baton that I weirdly still have.\nBecause you don't need a publisher.\nYou need a girlfriend who found a bookstore... to sell Pepperwood.\nSeriously?\nThat's amazing. That's amazing!\nI called all over and I finally found one.\nReagan saved the day!\nYou're amazing.\nThat's right.\nAll we need is, uh, 30 copies of the book.\nOh, well, we can make them.\nI mean, it'll be hard, but we could do it.\nWe could do it. We'll make 'em ourselves.\nFantastic. Uh, we just need 'em by tonight for his big reading.\nExcuse me, did you say \"big...\"\n\"a big reading tonight\"?\nYeah.\nWell, that sounds... public.\nWell, I mean, he's got to do a reading to sell the book.\nIs that bad?\nIs that bad?\nNo, it's good. I get...\nI get to do a reading tonight in front of people.\nYeah.\nI get to read in front of a bunch of people who are gonna judge me.\nThis is not bad. This is good. This is... (exhales)\nJess: See, this is another thing that Nick does when he's upset.\nAt least he's not running.\n(clattering)\nSo you want me to read in front of people.\nYou want me to read in front of living people...\n(voice squeaking): who are there to hear me read.\nAnd how will I... how will I even know what to read?\nYou're gonna read your book.\nI'll read my book. Fine.\nThis is good. I'm fine.\nDon't worry about me. I'm fine.\nOh, I feel like my heart is pumping out scalding hot toilet water.\nSee, a vivid description like that is gonna make the audience go wild.\nAh, the audience! I just forgot the audience, and now I remember the audience.\nI can't do this. I can't do it. I can't do it.\nAll right, here it is...\nThe Pepperwood Chronicles.\nI made a prototype.\nJess, that looks fantastic!\nThat looks really good.\nHow did you do that?\nOh, that's between me and my craft wagon.\nI wrote you.\nHey, um, how's he doing?\nNot very good.\nHmm.\nAnd if I'm being honest with you, I'm starting to freak out now.\nThis is me freaking out.\nDo I sometimes wonder if you're a robot?\nYeah.\nI've made you!\nYou're of me.\nJess: When Nick gets like this, he needs to be occupied.\nLuckily, we have tons of books to make.\nIt's got my name in it.\nJess (sing-songy): Book time!\nGather around, my little Guttenbergs!\nHere we go.\nHey, Jess, can I borrow your cactus gloves?\nOoh!\nMaking books, huh?\n Butterfly in the sky \n I can fly twice as high \n Take a look \n It's in a book. \nAh, you know the rest.\nJust, we put... we put 'em there.\nBacking away from an active craft project.\nAre you okay?\nOh, yeah, yeah.\nNo. Um, Reagan's a little insecure about being there for Nick.\nSo I want her to have this.\nOh.\nWow. I'm proud of you.\nYeah.\nThanks.\n(both laugh)\nThis is where you give me the cactus gloves.\nThis is really soothing.\nYou're a natural.\n(whispering): She's terrible.\nShe's ruining our bedroom.\nIt's like she's begrudgingly covering up graffiti.\nOh, there's a couple rough patches, but... that's what posters are for.\nJust calm down, okay? We can fix it later, but we have to keep her in here for Winston.\nHey. Since we're doing this, I got to say, do not like the color of your bathroom.\nYou know what?\nNow that I think about it, me either.\n(quietly): What?!\nLet's do that next.\nGreat.\nIt's special order robin's egg.\nIt's just paint!\nIt's not just paint.\nHey, guys... as much as I love a good whisper fight, I should go.\nCece: Oh, no! No, no, no.\nYou, uh, can not leave.\nWhy not?\nBecause we can't be alone together.\nBecause...?\nBecause... because... we're having marital problems.\nThat's... secret, which is part of our marital problem.\nShe's got a big mouth, but a great can.\nWhich is also part of our marital problems.\nI objectify her.\nAly: See. I knew something was up.\nEveryone was like, \"They're so perfect!\"\nAnd I was like, \"No. Something in that relationship is very, very broken.\"\nHey, Nick. Where's Reagan?\nGetting more glue. We ran out.\nHow many did you get done?\nOne... and I think we did it wrong.\nIt doesn't look right to me.\nYour reading's in three hours! It...\nLet's make some books! I think I have some really good glue in my non-mobile craft cart.\nYou're gonna help me?\nYeah!\nLet's do it.\n(both laugh)\nGod, this glue works great!\nOh, it smells great, too!\nIt really does.\n(both sniffing)\n(sniffing)\nOh, I love the smell of new books!\n(sniffing)\n(laughing): Yeah, me, too.\nMmm! New, new books.\nNew, new books!\nOh! Can I tell you something?I  feel great right now.\nI feel very good. I feel very confident.\nI am ready for that read.\nI think you're gonna crush it.\nI think I'll read the whole book in about two minutes.\nYeah. Just get in there. You'll...\n(sputtering gibberish)\nWhat?\nWhat?\nWhat?\nWhat?\n(sputtering gibberish)\nAnd people are gonna go nuts.\n(sputtering gibberish)\nThey're gonna be like, \"Yes, yes, we love this book.\"\nAnd they're gonna just buy every copy, and then you're gonna have to, like, print more.\nThat's what's gonna happen.\nDoes your hair always look like that?\nYeah.\nDo you have brown hair?\nDefinitely.\nWhy didn't you tell me?\nIt's a secret.\n(both laughing)\n(cackling)\nCheck this out. I'm gonna birth this book.\n(laughing)\n(groaning)\nHere you go. It's a baby book.\nOh!\n(imitates baby crying)\nCongratulations!\nIt's a paperback!\n\n\n\nHey, guys.\nReagan!\nReagan!\nReagan.\nReagan...!\n(Reagan sighs, Jess and Nick laugh)\nSorry that took so long.\nI got stuck behind this, uh, lady at the craft store that was buying 700 individually-priced buttons.\nMm.\nOh, they said to say hi to you.\nHi.\nAnd I got you a new shirt, Nick.\nOh, isn't that nice.\nPhew! What the hell is that smell, you guys?\nWe made a library!\nMm.\nIs this the glue?\nIt comes from my private collection.\nMm-hmm.\nIt's very strong.\nYou guys are so high.\nHow dare you?\nHow dare you?\nI'm not high at all.\nYou're high.\nWhoa!\n(clattering)\nYou guys, this says to use this in an open field.\nIt specifically says that a backyard is too small.\nYou're a backyard.\nVery good.\n(inhaling loudly)\nI think I should cancel this reading.\nNo way!\nI am in. I feel great for the reading.\nLet me just buckle up my shirt.\nWell, the problem with this author shirt is that it's made of honey.\nIt's not...\nThis shirt is too sticky.\nIt's because there's glue on your...\n'Cause it's made of honey, so...\nI'm canceling.\nYou cannot do a reading in this condition.\nNo! Don't cancel the reading!\nYou worked so hard to get it!\nI got a backpack full of Pepperwoods, and I'm ready.\nNick: Oh!\nJess: Aah!\nJess, I'm coming!\nReagan, call shotgun.\n(groaning)\n(groaning)\nAre you pulling?\nI can't feel you pulling.\nLet me get your legs!\nPlease don't drag her.\n(grunting)\n(whispering): Winston, where are you?\nWe are freaking out in increasingly weird ways.\nI'm at a costume shop, getting ready for the big proposal.\nA costume shop?\nAll in good time.\nNow, listen, when I text you, I need you to bring Aly to Malibu, okay?\nI don't want the two of us to drive back separately.\nPlus, I want to make out at red lights.\nOkay, Winston. Just how much longer?\nThis is very important to me.\nIf you mess this up, you ruin my life, okay?\nNo, Winston. Uh, uh...\nOkay, bye!\nNo. No, no, no. Uh...\nOoh!\nSo many marital problems we have.\nMy baby's got a real sweet tooth.\nJust the other day, she ate an entire sleeve of pecan sandies... and punched the top right off of a parking meter.\n(Cece clears her throat)\nIt was the craziest thing I've ever seen.\nShe yells at me constantly and... there's one time where she tipped over a table.\nHe gambled away another paycheck.\nOh, no!\nIt's the ponies. I'm addicted.\nRight, right, right.\nCece: It's true.\nAll the money that he wins on gambling, he puts up his nose.\nOh.\nIt's cocaine now, as well.\nLove me the ca-caine.\nAh, yeah.\nFeel invisible when I do it.\nThis feels like some sort of weird foreplay.\nI'm out of here.\nWait. No. Aly, please. Um...\nDon't leave me with this rage monster.\nOh, yeah. You... I mean, you want to see a rage monster?\nYou want me to show her the rage monster?\nWell, here you go.\nNo!\nJust...\nGosh darn.\n... tipping tables!\nAll right, that's...\nWait. Aly, Aly.\nUh, but I just...\nPlease don't leave.\nShe belongs in a mental hospital!\nWhat?!\nI know what's happening.\nYou guys are trying to distract me from some weird thing Winston's planning.\nUh, no. Aly, no.\nPossibly a prank?\nMight be a zotz, a goof.\nIf it's prank, please tell him I wore bad underwear today. Please.\nFrank Sinatra strikes again.\nIt's a prank, it's a prank.\nThat's exactly what it is.\nIt's a prank. Great.\nOh. Winston.\nStranded in Malibu.\nAll right, let's get this over with.\nWinston.\nHmm. Yep.\n(Nick sighs)\nThe good news is I'm feeling sober.\nThe bad news is maybe I'm too sober.\nYeah. I'm sobered up, too.\nGreat.\nWhy are my eyes so good?\nI can read everything from here.\nWhat does that mean?\nOh, my God. A secret world.\nOkay. I don't think she's sober at all.\n(gasps)\nOkay. Hi.\nThank you for supporting your local bookstore.\nQuick reminder: we're dying. Please buy things.\nI was feeling very confident before, but I'm losing some of it, so I think might just take one more quick pull.\nNo, no. No, no, no.\nJust one more quick pull.\nJust one more quick.\nOh, my goodness.\nIs this gonna be a problem?\nGet it together.\nAnd now, please welcome Nick Miller, author of The Pepperwood Chronicles.\n(whispering): No, no.\n(applause)\nGo ahead...\nNick.\nGo ahead. They called...\nWhat a wonderful day.\nQuick reminder: we are dying.\nI wrote this, every word.\nAll of that.\nMy hard work, not yours.\nIt's not a competition.\nIf everybody could stop looking at me, that'd be really great.\nIf you guys wouldn't mind just closing your eyes, as if you were at some sort of a show where you were asked to close your eyes.\nWhat?\nThank you.\nDo you mind looking down, sir?\n(whispering): Nick.\nAll of these are for sale.\nWhat's that? Yeah... coming.\nPatron: Is that it?\nUm...\nNick: Don't worry about me, I live here now.\nAll right, what are we gonna do? What's the plan?\nWell, it helps if you feed him something first.\nDo you have any meat? Or nuts?\nWhy would I have come to the bookstore with meat and nuts in my purse?\nOkay. Caramels.\nI don't have that.\nAll right. Just tell him you believe in him, and that he can do this.\nYeah. I'm not good at this.\nObviously. So... what would you say, Jess, if you were me?\nI would say...\n(sighs)\nNick, you're... one of the most amazing people I've ever met.\nEveryone here is lucky to hear your book, because it's a part of you.\nAnd if you fail, it doesn't change how special you are.\nAnd no matter what happens here, I'll always love you.\nOr something like that.\nThat made me tear up a little bit.\nI'm gonna use that.\nOkay.\nHi, Nick.\nWhat are you doing?\nI'm just hanging out in here. I'm just taking a break.\nJust, just having a moment... yeah.\nHey. No. You are... you are amazing.\nAnd you, you're, you're, uh, special boy.\nLike, uh, um... you know, you... like, uh, you're, you are... very special, you know what I'm saying.\nUh, and let me start over.\n(clears throat) Nick.\nI believe in you.\nHey, this thing's awesome.\nDid that guy write this?\nYeah. He sure did.\nThere's a sadness about him.\nI know what you mean.\nJess: Oh, there's movement.\n(sighs)\nSorry about that.

Good.\nRight, yeah.\nOkay, I'll try it, I'll do it.\nThat is some good advice.\nNow my final bit of advice, and don't get sensitive on this, but you got to change that top... it's terrible.\nAnd you got to throw sparkles on.\nI think...\nSparkles are in.\nI think my top is fine.\nSparkles...\n... are in!\nThere's a line.\nYou giving me fashion advice...\nSparkles...\n... is the line.\n... are in!\n(laughs)\nLook, I know it's not much, but, um, you know, I just thought it would be nice to spend some... koala-ty time together.\nEw.\n(Australian accent): G'Day, mate.\nOh, no.\nWhat's a fit Sheila like you doing with this sticky joey?\nYou were right. I said I didn't want to do anything today, but this is pretty fun.\n(British accent): Even though you forgot the Parmesan cheese.\nWell, that's not what he would sound like.\nI mean, if you're gonna say it, you might as well say it... the way he would...\n(both laugh)\nI can't even joke be mad at you, because you're so perfect.\nWell, you're the most ridiculous person I've ever met.\n(laughs)\nBut, you know, I honestly never get tired of you.\n(chuckles)\nOkay, this is gonna sound crazy, but I don't even care, I'm just gonna say it.\nWhy don't we get married?\n(laughs)\nNah...\n(grunts)\nYou said no?\nI have a proposal plan, okay?\nA plan. You know what, and I would not be in this mess if it wasn't for you convincing me to do Valentine's Day in the first place!\nI'm sorry, I'm just...\nYou know what, I'll just find her at work, okay?\nAnd I'll-I'll tell her yes then.\nI'm used to compromising my dreams.\nNo, Winston, you deserve an amazing engagement.\nYou're America's sweetheart, and you have to give Aly the proposal she deserves.\nAnd you have to do it today, 'cause she's probably freaking out right now.\nIt's a 21-step plan.\nI can't do it in one night.\nYou can't, but we can.\nJess, I can't make you do that.\nI mean, you had a whole day planned.\nI mean, it's a day I maintain was rooted in sadness.\nYou say I'm sad one more time, and I'm gonna take you to San Francisco, and we're gonna eat a little sourdough, maybe a little crab, and then I'm gonna throw you off the Golden Gate Bridge!\nDo you understand?\nYes, ma'am.\nNow, you go tell that son of a bitch cat of yours that he's gonna get a new mommy, 'cause we're gonna propose tonight!\nOkay.\nOkay, let's cut this 21-stage plan down to the essentials.\nOkay.\nGreat binder, by the way.\nYou get it at Captain Work?\nYou know it.\nDowntown or Third Street?\nDowntown.\nGood. Third Street's for idiots.\nI'm really loving your vibe right now.\nYou're really taking control.\nYeah. Uh, okay, Malibu cactus picnic. Did that.\nErotic skywriting. That's a cut.\nMm. See, I'm not sure if you understood...\nI know what erotic skywriting is.\nIt's in the sky.\nSpecial performance by the L.A. Children's Choir?\nThey're gonna come out all cute and small, singing Alison.\nWe're cutting.\nHuh?\nOkay, we can't get your ring in Atlanta.\nIt's the most affordable big city in America, so...\nWell, I have a local ring guy, so it's Cut-lanta.\n(sighs)\nOperation Bobcat?\nLet's call that Operation Cut Cat.\nNo, no, no, no.\nOh, I should have said Bob Cut.\nNext time.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\nMove your hand. Don't rip that.\nWhen Aly and I were first partners, we got called to break up a drug deal in a bus station bathroom.\nWhen we got there, wasn't nobody in there.\nJust a bobcat.\nLike, a bobcat running around.\nI shrieked. Of course, I was afraid for my life.\nBut Aly... she, she just laughed. (chuckles)\nLaughed and laughed and laughed.\nAnd, you know, it was that moment that made me realize I wanted to make her laugh for the rest of her life.\nAnd so, the plan... was to recreate that moment.\nSo...\nYou already have a bobcat costume, don't you?\nI'm an oddball romantic.\nYou bought a bobcat costume before you got a ring?\nYou really toe the line between sweetness and insanity.\nThat's the whole thing.\nSchmidt: I already e-mailed you the reports, but I know you love hard copies, and I love that about you.\nWhy?\nWhy?\nAll right.\nHappy bone-iver...\nSo, actually, I'm going to, uh, double-check those hard copies, and I'm gonna bring them to you, 'cause I want to make sure that they're ready for your brilliant eyes.\n(door closes)\nCece, what the hell are you doing in here?\nSurprise!\n(pictures clattering)\nCece, I love where your head's at.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd I love where your body is at even more, but I-I can't.\nWhat if I told you that I have the Star of David hidden somewhere on my body, and you have to find it?\nOkay.\nOkay. All right, let's do it.\nBut we got to do it really quick.\nI'm gonna stay dressed and just poke out like a cuckoo clock.\nNot here.\nI got a whole thing planned.\n(chuckles)\nHappy bone-iversary. (chuckles)\nWho would have thought the first moment that we ever were intimate with each other, you know?\nHoney, we're on the clock here, and it's getting very cold, so why don't we get this car started.\n(wind whistling)\n(chuckles)\nOh! No, no, no!\nOh! Oh!\nWhat?!\nMy executive ensemble!\nBoth: No, no, no!\n(grunts)\nThank you for coming, Trevlo.\nHey, got to sell these rings.\nDriving towards success.\nWe blessed.\nYou're always so positive, Trevlo.\nGot to stay positive.\nStay blessed.\nStay blessed.\nYeah, blessings.\n(whispers): Blessings raining down on you.\nOh.\nI think, we got one, Trevlo!\n$12,000? You out of your damn mind, man?\nNo, no, no.\nYou got to work with me, Trevlo.\nCan't do it, baby.\nCome on, Jess, you told me this dude was your friend.\nFriend is a stretch. I rear-ended him in a drive-thru, and he gave me his card.\nBlessings.\nWhat?!\nWhat?!\nWhat the hell you do to my fade, Jess?!\nI said a soft blend! Soft!\nI think it looks great, baby. It's all your perception.\nI look like if LeBron James turned around.\nCalm down.\nLook, I'm trying to stay calm, Jess, but I'm trying to fit a 21-step plan into three hours.\nStay blessed.\nI swear I'm gonna shove one of those blessings right up...\nTrevlo! I thought that was you!\nWow, look at you. Looking trim.\nBeen counting my steps, baby.\nYou know Trevlo, too?\nYeah, I was in the car when Jess hit him.\nStay blessed.\nStay blessed.\nStay blessed.\nEverybody stay blessed.\nStay blessed.\nAnyway, Schmidt's having a Valentine's Day emergency, and he called on Big Boy Cupid for help.\nCece's been calling me Big Boy Cupid because I'm super romantic now.\nWhat can I say? I'm in love.\nTrevlo: Nick, you in love?\nTell me about her.\nIs she positive?\nShe is not positive, but I can't wait to see what she got me for Valentine's Day.\nYou know what?\nCan't do it. The proposal is off.\nWhat?!\nI feel like I'm being a bad friend by putting you in this spot.\nWhat spot?\nJess, I saw your face when Nick said he was in love.\nDidn't have a face.\nYes, you're sad.\nI'm not sad.\nPlease, everyone, stop telling me I'm sad!\nA proposal is the last thing that you should be doing.\nI'm calling it.\nCome on!\nWe don't have a ring, we're rushing through all the steps.\nIt's better this way.\nI'll come up with a plan B, I'll make it up to her for Valentine's Day.\nYou got to take care of yourself.\nI feel very, very happy.\nStay home, relax.\nHave your meal with your private chef, and more than anything... stay blessed.\nDon't tell me to stay blessed.\nYou stay blessed!\n Stay blessed! \nYou know, it's still our bone-iversary.\nI'm too stressed.\nsex right now would be like picking a lock with a cold, wet French fry.\nNick. Nick!\nWhat?\n(whistles, caws)\nNick! Finally.\nNick!\nI couldn't see you. This thing was blocking me.\nLoretta's probably running the company by now.\nGet over here!\nSorry I'm late.\nThere was a TV crew by the Staples Center, so I had to jump around behind the guy to get on TV, but the good news, I got on TV, so I think I'm gonna be on the news.\nGreat.\nWhat do you got?\nHere, I got this for you, man. You got some pants.\nGot a suit jacket.\nYou brought that suit?!\nIt's a 62 short.\nI wore that to college graduation.\nIt was in your closet!\nAs motivation!\nHere you go, Cece. It's a beautiful dress.\nMy wedding dress?!\nAh, it's your wedding dress? I knew it looked familiar.\n'Cause you were at the wedding!\nYou're a buffoon idiot.\nOh, my God, it's Kim. It's Kim. It's Kim. Shh.\nShh, shh.\n(crying)\nThis is the start of a very long cry.\nAs a bartender, you really get to know the human cry.\n(continues crying)\n(sighs) So what else is going on with you guys?\n(food sizzling)\nSo is it just you?\nYup.\nYou know I'm quite famous, and you didn't want anybody else to experience my food?\nNo.\nJust me. Just my day.\nAre you sad 'cause you're on your own, on Valentine's night?\nUgh!\nDon't you start with me, Gordon Ramsay!\nI'm having just a great time.\nLiar!\nSorry. Bad habit.\nJust bring me the scallops, please.\nImpatient.\nMmm. Delicious.\n(sighs)\nScallops... aren't...\n(dish shatters)\n... for liars.\nWhy are you sad?\nI'm not sad.\nThen what are you?\nI'm mad!\nThere it is.\nI'm mad that Nick just decided to be a great boyfriend.\nWhere does all this effort come from?\nReagan gets Mr. Cupid, and I got, like, some nudie card.\nThis bread is incredible.\nYou taste the crust?\nIt's really good.\nAnd you know what else pisses me off?\nThe fact that everyone thinks I'm sad.\nI mean, Winston canceled his engagement 'cause of it.\nThen bloody do something about it!\nBrilliant! Uh, just a reminder: I'm not required to clean up.\nWinston can't throw away his dreams because of me!\nThen don't let him.\nHey, Jess, what's up?\nWinston, I'm not sad. I'm mad!\nBloody brilliant.\nOkay. Cool.\nThanks for the call.\nI'm not letting you throw away your dreams, okay?\nYou're proposing in that bus station bathroom, and I am going to help you.\nI'll meet you there in one hour, and I'm bringing the bobcat suit.\nBobcat suit?\nThank God, because my plan B was weak!\n(grunts)\n(sighs)\n(grunts)\n(whoops)\n(chuckles): I'm the man.\nCece: Okay, she's not looking. Come on, let's go.\nWe can go now, we can go.\nNo, don't move.\nIf we move, we... I'm-I'm fired.\nNick: She's not gonna get off this roof.\nI know how to handle this.\nAre you out of your mind?\nYou're just gonna materialize out of thin air on a rooftop?\nEasy. I work here. I'm a window washer, and I finally got to the top floor.\nYou don't like that one? How about this one?\nI'm a traffic guy, and I fell out of the news chopper.\nWhat are you talking about?\nAll these work perfectly.\nI'll just pick my favorite on the way over.\nSit down, you nincompoop.\nThis is completely my fault.\nI just really wanted to do something big for you, because you do so many romantic things for me.\nAnd I just wanted to find some way to show you... how much I love you.\nInstead, all I did was mess up your job.\n(sighs)\nCece.\nI'm sorry.\nYou mean more to me... than any job ever will.\nScrew it.\nScrew what? What?\n(sighs)\n(sniffles)\nI love Cece!\nOh, well, then I love Schmidt!\nI love him.\nLove you.\nLove you.\nWell, this is a productive use of time.\nWhat the hell is going on, Schmidt?\nAnd what is that guy doing?\nI'm a chimney sweep.\nAll these are clogged.\nA chim...?\nClogged, clogged, clogged.\nAre you crying? That's the question. Are you crying?\nI just met my birth mother.\nI don't have to explain myself to a chimney sweep.\nSchmidt, why are you dressed like a Little Rascal?\nThe truth is it's... it's our bone-iversary.\n(groans)\nKim, this job means so much to me, but... she means a lot more.\nSo... if this costs me the promotion, then...\nI can live with that.\nYou know, this is the first conversation we've ever had where you weren't lying to me.\nIt's nice.\nI'm not flaming with rage.\nAnd by the way, I've noticed you're working your ass off.\nNow get back to work.\nCece, your d\u00e9colletage looks beautiful.\nThank you.\nOkay. Yeah.\nIt cleans up pretty nice.\nAnd this ring is perfect.\nHow did you get Trevlo to come down on the price?\nI don't think it's a legitimate business, and that's the real answer.\nAnyway, I got it done.\n(chuckles)\nOkay. I called the station, they're sending Aly down on a public disturbance call.\nNice.\nI'm nervous, but, you know, I'm really glad we are doing this, you know.\nIf I didn't propose in a public bathroom while wearing a bobcat costume, I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.\n(indistinct police radio chatter)\nOh, here she comes.\nUh, put your head on.\nOkay.\nOh, nice touch.\nPolice! You have five seconds to pull your pants up.\nYour bus is leaving.\nCome on, man. I'm having a really bad day.\n(roars)\n(screams)\n(Winston groans)\nAh, that's a concussion.\nJust a little bump, right?\nWhat is going on?\nHappy Valentine's Day.\nWhat?\nJess, why did you decorate a bathroom?\nOh, boy.\nWhy is Winston dressed like a tiger?\nHe's dressed as a bobcat, but...\nI got something I want to say.\nWhen my head hit the wall, it knocked my eyes out of focus.\nSo I'm gonna need you to read it for me.\nOh, my God. Okay. Um...\nI'm still a little woozy.\nJess: Aly, um, look at Winston, but listen to me.\nUm, fellas!\nChoir:  Alison... \nWhat the hell?\nWinston wanted a kids choir, but this is all we could get on such short notice.\nThey're called Protect and Swerve.\n Oh, Alison \n My aim is true... \nAly, I'm in love with you. (humming) I love your face, your mind... and your butt.\nGood opening, good opening.\nAs a young black man, I never thought I'd feel safe with a police officer. When I met you, I threw away all my shoes, 'cause they made me feel like I was walking on air.\n I'm not gonna get too sentimental \n Like those other sticky valentines \n Ooh-ooh... \nYou're the most amazing woman I've ever met, and I have something to ask you. But first, I'm gonna describe in vivid detail our first sexual encounter.\nOh, don't do that.\nOkay, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not gonna read...\nYou know what we did.\nYeah.\nIt's very long.\nHere we go, okay. Um...\nI have a complicated relationship with God.\nNo.\nOkay.\nHere we go, okay. Um...\n(choir continues humming)\nI don't think anyone on Earth gets to feel as proud (voice breaks): as I do just to call you my partner.\nThat really got me.\n(sniffles)\n(crying): And now I want to ask you to be my partner for the rest of my life.\nYou want to what... you want... now you want to what?\nI'm not sad! These are happy tears.\nJess, I got this.\nWhat was that last...\nWh-what did she say?\n(groans)\nAly, the only reason I said no earlier is because I needed to show you how much I wanted to say yes.\nI want you to be my partner for the rest of my life.\n Oh, Alison... \nOfficer Nelson...\n(gasps)\n... will you marry me?\nOf course I will, Officer Bishop.\n My aim is true... \n(choir humming)\nCome here.\n(laughs)\n(choir cheering, whooping)\nWhat are we doing in here?\nWell, I thought you'd like to see your husband's new office.\n(gasps)\nI got the promotion.\nShe just told me.\n(laughs)\nLook at this place!\nYou've got a wet bar, you've got a thermostat.\nAnd tickets to something called the Clippers.\nYou wanted to see me?\nActually, Loretta, I wanted you to see me... in my new office.\nThat'll be all. Thank you so much.\n(door creaking)\n(beeping)\n(sighs)\nAll right, Loretta, get out of here.\n(door closes)\nHappy anniversary.\nHappy anniversary.\nHey. You got to come out here.\nWinston's letting everyone try on the bobcat costume.\nOh. I'll be, I'll be right out.\nUh, my Valentine's Day gift from Reagan finally came.\nThat's nice.\nYeah. She got me a necklace.\n(chuckles) Did you want a necklace?\nNo. Not really.\nI don't know if I'm a necklace guy.\nWell, some guys call it a chain.\nA chain?\nYeah.\nI call a chain the thing you put on tires in the snow.\nOh.\nI got to say, I don't know what I expected from her, but it's definitely not this.\nI'm sorry, Nick. If it makes you feel any better, I spent the day cleaning blood off of a wall in a bus station bathroom.\n(chuckles)\nWell, Happy Valentine's Day, Jess.\nHappy Valentine's Day, Miller.\nTo the happy couple.\nAll: Cheers.\nOh.\nCome on.\nOh, he's still concussed.\nOh.\nMm-hmm.\nTo a beautiful engagement you probably won't remember.\nCheers.\nCheers.\nCece: You haven't tasted a drop.\nWinston: It won't go in.\nNick: Then stop doing it!"}, {"title": "06x17 - Rumspringa.txt", "script": "\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Big Dinner, where the news is big, and the dinner is regular size.\nNot to be confused with Big Supper, where we eat dinner and we watch the movie Big.\nThe movie about a grown woman who has sex with a little boy?\nWhat?\nShe didn't know.\nSchmidt: Tonight we gather to celebrate Jess and I's final weekend inside the chrysalis of professional mediocrity before Monday, when we burst forth in fully pupated positions.\nDirector of...\nPrincipal Day.\nNon-Television, Non-Radio West Coast Marketing.\nAnd Principal Day.\nSorry.

Give me a second.\nGive me a second.\nI think I know how to keep this party going just a little bit longer.\nWelcome to the distillery.\nI'm gonna, uh, make sure that, that's okay.\nOh, you know what? It's, um, it's probably just an old-timey Danish door.\nYou just need to jiggle the, um, the dorhandtag.\nYeah. I'm doing that.\nMaybe there's another door.\n(jiggling door knob)\nNo, that's it.\nAre we trapped?\nWiggle the dorhandtag!\nIt won't budge!

I got the bird.\nIsn't this fun?\nI told you I didn't want a Rumspringa.\nThis might've worked when you were 20, but we're adults now, and you can't handle adult problems by forgetting about them.\nYou're right.\nMaybe I handle my problems like a child.\nMaybe I decorate my room like a child.\nI mean, I even undress like a child.\n(grunting)\nDo you think that's what Reagan was getting at about my room?\nYeah.\nDo you think Reagan thinks I'm a child?\nMm-hmm.\nOkay, now I'm freaking out!\nAnd I'm usually the rock of this group.\nOnce you lose old Nicky Miller, the whole thing falls apart.\nWinston: Aah.\nAah, okay.\nCece: She's gonna pop!\nHow far apart are the contractions?\nWho's asking?\nI don't know.\nLet's take a look.\n(screams)\nWah.

And the ma\u00c3\u00aetre d'?\n - I rented the tractor in his name.\n The next call he'll be making will be from the police station.\n Welcome to Ass Strat.\n Muffin?\n Muffin.\n They're homemade.\n -

That's very flattering.\n - Please come and talk to these girls.\n They're obsessed with Pepperwood.\n I don't have time for this.\n I'm only on page two.\n And page one is just a dedication to Winston.\n Ugh.\n Come on.\n The kids used to love Vice Principal Jess, and now they won't have anything to do with Principal Jess.\n It's like I'm living in my own damn adorable shadow.\n Please?\n You-you might get some ideas from your audience.\n My audience is the men who built this great country.\n Your students would never understand that Pepperwood's just a New Orleans story about a guy fighting with the alligator within.\n Well, could you just do it for me?\n Yeah, I'll.\n .\n I mean, I'll do it for you, Jess, sure.\n Well, then why didn't you You know what, I'm happy with where we ended up, but you took me on a real spin around the block there.\n So, as you can see here, I treat Furguson right.\n - Mm-hmm.\n - WINSTON: Okay?\n - Organic kitty litter.\n - Mm-hmm.\n I got the miniature piano, the tiny, tiny treadmill, and right over here is where we do couples yoga.\n (gags)\n Fish nuggets?\n Oh, well, that would explain his recent oily eliminations, which I document on the cloud.\n You track his poop?\n What, you just weigh his hairballs and clock out?\n -

How about this?\n - Mm-hmm.\n We settle things the way we do on the street.\n - Mm-hmm.\n - Catcall.\n - What?\n - We let Furguson decide.\n - Oh, yeah.\n - Fine.\n We'll leave the decision in his paws.\n Which are now incredibly strong, thanks to his new set of, uh, mini-dumbbells.\n - You're welcome.\n - (chuckling)\n Ooh, ooh!\n Okay, Pepper-heads!\n Get ready for a memorable experience, which I hope you will recount at your weddings, which I will also be at, brought to you by your favorite principal-slash-friend, Jessica Day.\n Please welcome your favorite author, Nick Miller!\n -

The kissing.\n - OMG, the romance.\n - The make out scene at the levee.\n - Oh, the romance.\n Guys!\n Pepperwood's about way more than just a romance.\n It's it's, uh, it's about life, you know?\n Race.\n The sexualization of the American handgun.\n - (whispers): Keep it clean.\n - Okay.\n It's a story about his ambiguous relationship with with justice.\n But the romance is amazing.\n It made me realize it doesn't matter if I'm straight or gay; I'm just me.\n You got that from my book?\n That's yeah.\n That was positive.\n Do you think that's because of the gay dog character?\n - Yeah.\n - What I really respect about that is it's never mentioned that he's a gay dog.\n But you got that from the writing.\n And that's pretty dope.\n You write female desire so well.\n - Thank you.\n - That's okay to say, right?\n Yah, Ramona.\n I'm-I'm just like you.\n I'm your princi-pal.\n I'm your friend.\n I like to just throw on my rollerblades, and just go out there and think.\n NICK: Can I ask you guys about the scene -

I did it already.\n - You did?\n - Okay.\n I guess I'll just - Enjoy your lunch.\n Yeah.\n So you're saying that Lady Diamante doesn't realize that it's Pepperwood's underwear for years later, like, 20 years later?\n Maybe she never realizes.\n Yes.\n That's what I was gonna say, too.\n We you and me, we're right here.\n - All right.\n - (school bell rings)\n Wow.\n This is incredible.\n I mean, so many great ideas here.\n It feels like maybe The Pepperwood Chronicles could be, like, a whole series.\n Well, I mean, it's called The Pepperwood Chronicles, so I assumed there'd be more than one.\n Yeah, well, I can't thank you guys enough.\n - All right, I'll see you at home.\n - Home?\n - You guys live together?\n - Yeah, we're roommates.\n Yeah.\n This job doesn't pay very much, but it's very rewarding to hang out with cool people like you guys.\n You guys are actually, like, friends?\n You ready to get your mind really blown off?\n We used to date.\n -

Are you really not gonna turn around?\n - Not yet.\n This brand will be my legacy.\n And this is where you come in.\n Ooh!\n You had that timed right!\n I'm going to start using my first name again.\n Schmidt, I think that is a very bad idea.\n I have no choice!\n When I was born, my parents gave me a name.\n Don't do this, Schmidt.\n Ain't nothing but pain down that road.\n It is the name that I was called for most of my life, and I want my name back.\n Isn't this fun?\n Remember, we used to come here all the time, every time you won a tennis match.\n - That was your other daughter.\n - Oh, yeah, yeah.\n You-You were always in a production of Annie, but never Annie, though.\n Priscilla, come here, come here.\n I want you to meet my daughter, Jessica.\n Remember?\n I told you about her.\n She's the one that doesn't play tennis.\n Oh, the teacher from Hollywood.\n (laughs)\n Well, two rum raisin sundaes and whatever my daughter wants.\n (Priscilla and Bob laugh)\n You.\n (laughs)\n (quietly): Her husband fell down a spiral staircase.\n - What?\n - He kept falling, falling, continually falling.\n It was awful.\n He didn't die.\n But when he found out that he had become a viral sensation - he killed himself.\n - Ugh.\n I know how he feels.\n Jess, are you still upset about Nick?\n You got to, you got to move past that.\n It's hard.\n You don't know what it's like to be alone.\n I do know what it's like.\n - Ashley and I broke up.\n - What?!\n - Yeah.\n - When?\n Yeah, about six months ago.\n Uh, but I-I didn't want to worry you.\n Dad.\n It's my job to worry.\n Was it the 40-year age difference?\n Were you tired of waiters just asking again and again if it was a daddy-daughter dinner?\n Sorry, no, that's not REAGAN: You said that the pill sold itself, so let me ask you, is the pill a cure for a kick in the balls?\n Because you're gonna need it.\n - Oh, no.\n - Hey, Nicky, what's up?\n Uh, I can wait.\n No, it's okay, go ahead, I'm sorry.\n I want to tell you (mouths)\n - What?\n - I said what I needed to say.\n Nothing came out of your mouth.\n I feel like we're on a train.\n Where are we going?\n We're going to San Diego.\n - What?\n - I panicked and it just came out.\n Let me tell you something, sister, your plan didn't work.\n This wasn't my plan.\n Well, you brought up trains, didn't you?\n And you got in my head.\n San Diego part?\n Well, that's on me.\n I'm not engaging with you over this.\n - So, what do we do now?\n - I don't know, Nick.\n I've never experienced a person trying to break up with someone, and instead inviting them on a beach vacation.\n I didn't do this on purpose.\n I feel like you led me here.\n - This is not on me.\n - So what do you want me to do?\n You want me to go break up with her down in San Diego?\n I don't, I don't care at this point.\n - Why?\n Because it's private?\n - Live your life, man.\n Because the weather is really nice?\n And what happens if it doesn't work out?\n I'm just gonna go move down to Mexico and start a new life?\n No one's suggesting any of this.\n You're a genius.\n (laughs)\n Thank you, Aly.\n I knew I came to the right person.\n I'll do it.\n That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I feel like I should call San Diego to warn them about you.\n But you seem convinced, so if it gets you out of here faster, God bless.\n - Do you believe in God, Aly?\n - I believe in hell and I'm in it.\n - Oh, this is hell?\n - Yes!\n Then why don't you stay out of my business?!\n That's all I'm trying to do, but you keep bringing me your business!\n Ah, to hell with you!\n We're going to San Diego!\n - Fine!\n - Fine!\n - Go!\n - I'm going!\n Don't say anything.\n I should have known right from the start.\n On our honeymoon, we're in the ocean, a-a-and Ashley sees a shark coming towards us.\n You know what she does?\n She pushes me in front of it and says, \"Eat him! Eat him!\" \n - What?\n - That-that was a clue.\n - That was a clue.\n - I just hate thinking of you all alone in that house.\n I'm fine.\n I got my cans.\n Gets me out of bed in the morning.\n - What if you met someone new?\n - Oh, no.\n - JESS: Really.\n - BOB: Aw, no.\n Dad, what about \n - what about Priscilla?\n - What?\n - What?\n Come on.\n - No.\n No.\n I'm an old man.\n She doesn't want an old man.\n Look.\n I've got a Band-Aid on my hand.\n Not on the finger, the hand.\n That is an old-man thing.\n Okay.\n Hey, Priscilla.\n Oh, no, no, no, no.\n Hi.\n I was wondering if you would like to get a decaf coffee and talk about local news with my dad.\n Really, Bob?\n You want to take me out?\n - Ha, ha, ha, you - (laughs)\n Let's do it.\n Let's do it.\n Yeah, I have a new jean jacket I've been wanting to break out.\n It's stone-washed.\n BOB: Okay.\n Okay.\n Well, that was just about the cutest thing I've ever seen.\n Even though this morning I thought you were married.\n What about you?\n I'm supposed to be cheering you up.\n You did cheer me up.\n You got me off of the couch.\n It's good to be out of the house.\n You kids have fun.\n Okay, thanks.\n So this is a surprise.\n Where do you think we should go?\n Where do you think we should go?\n Look, Schmidt, we both know there's only room for one Winston.\n And we found that out the hard way, didn't we?\n Homecoming weekend, 2002.\n - I'm Winston!\n I'm Winston!\n - I'm Winston!\n I'm Winston!\n We can't live like this!\n - Only one Winston.\n - Body slam!\n Get off!\n Get off!\n You'll kill him!\n We have tried every single variation.\n Fat Winston, Thin Winston.\n Too derogatory.\n Black Winston, Jew Winston.\n Obviously problematic.\n Hot Winston, Ugly Winston.\n Now that nearly tore us apart.\n Which is why we came up with the one-Winston rule.\n Yeah, but those were angry times.\n Let's make it double W's.\n (exhales)\n Welcome back, Winston.\n It's good to be back, Winston.\n - REAGAN: San Diego.\n - The wonderful San Diego.\n - Where are we staying?\n - Not sure.\n Maybe we're gonna get the nicest hotel in the city, huh?\n Maybe you're gonna stay there, and maybe I'm gonna head back to Los Angeles today.\n I'm gonna stay in San Diego, and you're gonna go back?\n Who knows what's gonna happen down there?\n That's the fun of a trip like this.\n Nick, you would tell me if you were gonna murder me, right?\n No, 'cause then you could prepare for it, you silly.\n What is wrong with you?\n - What is wrong with me?\n - Yeah.\n The guy taking you to San Diego the Paris of Southern California?\n - Okay.\n - You're losing it.\n I'm acting totally normal.\n You need a drink just to chill out.\n - What is wrong with you?\n - Getting those drinks.\n MAN (over P. A. ): This stop, Anaheim.\n (mouths)\n (train horn blows)\n (mouthing)\n You should have seen him.\n The only time my dad gets that nervous is when he doesn't know where to print out his boarding pass.\n It's so weird to think of him dating again.\n - BOB (moaning): Oh!\n Oh - Wait.\n What is that?\n It sounds like someone's moving a washing machine.\n Oh, my God, my dad's boning!\n - My dad's boning!\n My dad's boning!\n - Oh, my God, listen to me.\n Get out of the house.\n Get out of the house!\n (cans clattering loudly)\n - BOB: Jess?\n Is that you?\n - No.\n Yes.\n I mean, no, it's the cans.\n I just, um Finish what you're doing.\n No, don't finish.\n I mean, everyone deserves to finish oh, God!\n - (cans clattering)\n - Oh, cans!\n - Can we talk about this?\n - Yeah, just one sec.\n I'm just replacing the sound of your skin slapping against someone else's with the sound of crushing metal.\n I didn't know you were gonna be home.\n I thought you were gonna be out having a day.\n And you were supposed to be having coffee.\n You just put out on the first date?\n We had a connection.\n I-I think I'm in love with her.\n Oh, my God, I need more cans.\n I got to have more cans.\n Hey, you know, I'm a passionate guy.\n - All right.\n - What are you doing, Dad?\n Well, I mean, you were nice enough to help me to move on.\n Now I'm gonna see if I can find somebody for you.\n Got it.\n My best friend Ray.\n His son John.\n Well, he's a little heavyset, but, you know, he makes a good living.\n Dad, put the Rolodex down.\n Look, we're not in the same boat, okay?\n I can't move on.\n I love him.\n Nick?\n What do you see in him?\n I mean, he looks like the only white waiter at a Chinese restaurant.\n There isn't a logical explanation, but it is what it is.\n I love him.\n I wish I didn't, but I do.\n - Come here.\n - Dad, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the recycling plant.\n It closes in an hour.\n From now on, I will be Winston Schmidt, and he will be Winston Bishop.\n We are both Winstons.\n Wait, your first name is Winston?\n - Did I know that?\n - No.\n I have not slept in 36 hours.\n Well, you should get some sleep.\n - Isn't that right, Winston?\n - Oh, absolutely, Winston.\n Sleep is very important.\n It is the most important, Winston.\n Okay, this is already too much.\n In my head it wasn't this annoying.\n Winston, why don't you just go by \"The Bish\"?\n - I'm sorry, are you talking to me?\n - You know I'm talking to you.\n I knew she was talking to you.\n - You knew the whole time?\n - Yeah.\n Ooh, I couldn't tell.\n Wait a minute, why does Winston - Yes?\n - Oh, my God.\n Why does my Winston have to change his name?\n - Schmidt, don't you have a middle name?\n - I do have a middle name.\n - It's Saint-Marie.\n - Hmm.\n - And obviously I can't go by that.\n - That's hilarious.\n Oh, hello, hello!\n Wait, what are you doing here?\n Oh, well, I couldn't break up with Reagan, - so I jumped off the train.\n - Hmm?\n - Problem, problem solved.\n - What's up with you guys?\n - Why didn't I know about this?\n - I don't know, Schmidt, 'cause you weren't around, I guess.\n\n\n\n Well, actually, I'm Winston now.\n I'm using my first name again.\n Uh actually there can't be two Winstons.\n It nearly destroyed us.\n Nick, hold up, can we go back to that moment where you jumped off a train?\n Sure.\n You find that part interesting?\n Okay, I don't care about the answer, but I feel like I got to ask, as someone who works in law enforcement where is Reagan?\n Well, she's probably getting off at the next stop, and then she'll be on her way here for some sort of a reckoning, I would imagine.\n \"Problem solved\" was probably a bit of a, an overstatement.\n The good news is that I don't have to break up with her 'cause now she's gonna break up with me.\n - Oh, Nick.\n - What is wrong with you?\n It's gonna be okay, Nick.\n Give Winston a hug.\n - Come on.\n Here we go.\n - Here you go, Winston.\n I meant \"me Winston.\n \" - I'm \"me Winston,\" too!\n - Hey, guys!\n Reagan's on her way.\n I've got too much to deal with to deal with this two Winstons thing.\n What, I can't have a first name because you left some woman on a train?\n Don't put that on me, man!\n I'm not calling you Winston, Schmidt.\n 'Cause if I do, then what am I gonna call the real Winston?\n Call him I don't care!\n I don't care!\n - Hey, Winston, you want to get a drink?\n - Sure.\n - I'm down.\n - I was talking to that Winston.\n - Oh.\n - After the drink, you want to get some dinner, Winston?\n - Ooh, you know your boy hungry.\n - Yes.\n That time I was talking to this Winston.\n - So, I can come if you want.\n - I'm down to go.\n No, I'm trying to figure it out, okay?\n Wait, time out.\n Are we eating, or are we not eating?\n They're both real Winstons, but the old Winston is now The Bish.\n I'm not calling my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 \"The\" anything.\n Nah, man, this is taking me to a bad place.\n - I'm having I'm having cold feet.\n - What?\n Yeah, the two Winstons thing is not gonna work Nick is right.\n You've had Winston for 15 years.\n It's my turn.\n I'm Winston.\n You will never be Winston.\n - Oh, you want to dance?\n Yeah.\n - Oh, yeah?\n Okay.\n - Come on.\n - Come on.\n Come on.\n - Okay, what is happening?\n - WINSTON: Come on.\n - SCHMIDT: Come on.\n - I used to live by myself.\n - Come on.\n - Come on.\n I had covered parking, I was happy.\n - I'm Winston.\n - Guys, no.\n It's not about you, man.\n I am Winston.\n Shut up!\n I'll kill you!\n I'll murder you!\n NICK: I can't do this right now.\n I got too much on my plate.\n - I'm Winston.\n - I'm Winston.\n - Nah, I'm Winston.\n - Ah, I'm Winston.\n Yet, somehow, all the Michaels in the world manage to deal with this every day.\n Mm-hmm.\n Go to sleep, go to sleep.\n (phone rings)\n - Hello?\n - Mr.\n Day.\n It's Nick Miller.\n - Is Jess there?\n - She's out.\n Can I take what I assume will be an idiotic message?\n Ah, it's actually, it's kind of private.\n Okay, fine.\n Talk to you later.\n Fine, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.\n I'm breaking up with Reagan and it didn't quite go as planned.\n I'm, I'm in a really bad situation and Jess always says the right thing and I, I really need her.\n Let me, let me ask you a question.\n You're in the ocean with Jess, and a shark starts coming towards you.\n - What do you do?\n - Which ocean?\n I-I don't know, Pacific.\n - What type of shark?\n - What the hell difference does it make?\n Well if it's a hammerhead, you just tickle it between the sideways eyes and you have a companion for life.\n Then you got tiger sharks, you got whale sharks, you got trumpet sharks, which I believe are a thing if not, it definitely should be.\n It's just a regular shark.\n You know what?\n Good-bye.\n Okay, vague premise aside, I don't know what I would do, but if Jess was with me, I'm sure I'm sure we'd be okay.\n She's got that giant heart that's, that's part compass and, and part flashlight and she's just the greatest person I have ever met.\n Bob?\n Does that answer your question or what?\n It does.\n Weirdly enough, it does.\n But I also don't accept your weird-ass premise, man, 'cause it's absolutely preposterous - REAGAN: Nick.\n - NICK: Oh, my God.\n She's here.\n Nick.\n Nicholas, I can see you.\n Hey.\n How was San Diego?\n Hey, so Reagan's in your room, packing up her stuff.\n What'd you say to her?\n Nothing.\n I-I didn't say anything.\n I just, uh, crawled out from under the bed where I was hiding.\n She said, \"It's over,\" which makes sense, and then I came in here, and this is now my fifth beer in as many minutes.\n - I'm impressed.\n - No, you shouldn't be.\n I once drank nine beers in five minutes.\n I hear that cry for help, but I meant the breakup.\n You ended a relationship without any confrontation.\n You got what you wanted.\n Then why do I feel so terrible?\n Maybe you feel bad because your relationship with Reagan actually meant something to you, and you ended it like it didn't.\n Right.\n I'm sorry I put you in the middle of this, Aly.\n But I'm also glad you were here 'cause I feel like we bonded.\n It was one of the most frustrating days of my entire life.\n I'm exhausted.\n I feel like a single mom in a mop commercial.\n Welcome to the loft.\n Hey.\n Taking a little trip?\n I hear San Diego's lovely.\n I regret that.\n I'm sorry I left you on the train, Reagan.\n You deserve better than that.\n The truth is, is I wanted to break up with you, and I didn't know how to.\n Okay.\n I mean, I'm not mad anymore, more just scared of what it must be like to have to live inside of your head.\n Look, I'm sorry.\n It's okay.\n I've been thinking about breaking up with you for a while.\n So, we just wanted really different things.\n I'm not good at good-byes, Nick.\n I'm not good at good-byes either.\n I think I'm gonna go stand in the closet for a little bit.\n Okay.\n - Okay.\n - Okay.\n Bye, Nick.\n Yeah, bye, Reagan.\n What do you want?\n To be your friend.\n If you need the name Winston to get you to where you're going, then I'm not gonna stand in your way.\n You're a good friend.\n Uh, uh, what will I call you?\n Well, I was gonna give Saint-Marie a whirl, but then I was like, nah, that's a girl's name.\n And I thought about Two-Shoes.\n - Two-Shoes.\n - Two-Shoes, yeah.\n But then, in certain shoes that I have, I have three of them, so so I'm just gonna stick with The Bish.\n Come here.\n Thank you, The Bish.\n Thanks, Winston.\n Hey, you know what?\n Why don't you come on inside Very weird.\n Strange man.\n I love Wednesday nights.\n And this one's even more special, 'cause I got my name back.\n I love you, Cece.\n I love you so much, Winston.\n Oh, God.\n I don't like it!\n I don't like it!\n I don't like it!\n - Damn it!\n - Ugh Take your name back.\n SCHMIDT: I don't want it.\n - What's wrong with the name Winston?\n - It's horrible, just take it back.\n Worst name in the entire history of names.\n What'd you say about my name?\n Stop.\n N You know what, I don't care.\n Come on.\n (shouts)\n Cha-ching.\n Hey, hey, Jess!\n Jess!\n I've been trying to call you.\n I-I talked to Nick.\n - What?\n - He called looking for you, and you know, oddly, I-I see what you see in him.\n It doesn't matter.\n He has a girlfriend.\n He and Reagan broke up.\n And you know something?\n I don't even think he realizes it, but he's still in love with you.\n (grunting, shouting)\n I got you, I got you!\n I got you!\n Got your arm!\n I'm gonna break it.\n WINSTON: Aah, that's my arm!\n I need it, I need it!\n It's only a matter of time before life begins You talk to a stranger and suddenly you're friends There she goes.\n Off to college.\n Circle of life.\n Okay.\n Before you even learn to break or bend (sighs)\n This is right.\n I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna profess my love to Nick.\n - I'm very proud of you, sweetie.\n - Thanks, Dad.\n I'm proud of you, too.\n You really just humped your way right into things, didn't you, Priscilla?\n - I kinda wanted the front seat.\n - I called it.\n"}, {"title": "06x22 -

Okay?\n - You're right.\n - You're right, okay.\n - All right.\n Okay.\n (both sigh)\n - I should've worn shorts.\n - No, no.\n I would've looked amazing in shorts.\n I got rid of all the shorts, you nut-ball.\n You are really grumpy this morning.\n Well, I was up late last night, - talking to Cece about you.\n - For what?\n Nick, I want to tell you something, but but I can't.\n So I'm just gonna ask you this: why on earth do you think that you are so okay with this Reagan breakup?\n Reagan and I are at different places of our life.\n It's fine.\n Why hasn't Jess called me back?\n You guys are pretty good friends, right?\n But if you remember correctly, you didn't even want Jess to move in to the loft.\n Nick, why do you think that is?\n I'm pretty freaked out by sanitary napkins.\n Why don't you think you wanted Jess to move in to the loft?\n I don't know, 'cause I, 'cause I was afraid.\n Nick, you have been in love with this girl from the moment you opened the door and you first laid eyes on her.\n I have never seen you look at anyone else like that in my entire life.\n Except maybe, on a few occasions, me.\n I've never looked at you the same way I look at Jess.\n - There's been a few times.\n - I there's never been a time.\n You looked at Coach maybe once or twice like that.\n Me, several times.\n Winston, never.\n Let's table it.\n You're wrong.\n The first time I saw Jess was I was standing in her empty room, and I was looking out the window.\n - She was trying to get in the building.\n - Okay.\n Pretty hilarious.\n She didn't have her glasses on, and she was bumping into stuff.\n Will you listen to yourself?\n I shouldn't be telling you this, but Jess is not in Portland.\n She's here.\n And she's packing up her stuff because she's going to move out of the loft for good.\n Nick.\n Wait, she's gonna move out of the loft?\n For once in your life, don't be afraid.\n Ready to come in and talk?\n Hello.\n I'm, uh, Winston Schmidt, Nick's associate.\n That's right.\n Children's literature just got a brand-new daddy.\n What?\n Children's literature just got a brand-new daddy.\n Don't say that here anymore, okay?\n Thank you.\n So sorry I'm late, but Sadie would not stop going on about her divorce, and I was like, \"Girl, can you just be quiet \"and look at my vagina, please?\" The fact that we have the same gynecologist really makes me feel closer to you.\n Wait, is this all you have packed?\n I mean, Nick's gonna be here in two hours.\n - I know.\n - Hey.\n You know what?\n If this is too hard right now, you don't have to do this.\n Just give yourself some time and think it through.\n If my stuff is here, I'll just end up living here again.\n You know me; I live where my stuff lives.\n When I come back for the school year, I'll find a new place.\n All right.\n Well, if we're gonna do this, then we better get moving.\n Yep.\n My God, I'm gonna miss you so much.\n I'm gonna miss you so much, too.\n But it's just one summer.\n It's fine.\n Okay, I know, but I'm just gonna miss you.\n Me, too.\n -

This party is a disaster.\n - I know.\n Our guests have no questions for the panel.\n Wait, no, wait, look.\n - This is for anyone.\n - Mm-hmm.\n Daddy's butt?\n (children laugh)\n (Schmidt groans)\n It's just, this is the first birthday party that our daughter is actually going to remember.\n If it's anything less than perfect, I'm going to hire a professional samurai - to chop me in half.\n - That seems proportional.\n Okay, fine.\n You know what?\n You're right.\n - Let's break out the booze.\n - Thank you.\n Put some toilet tissue in the bounce house.\n Vodka Soda-Mayor.\n Right here.\n Here you go, sir.\n A Ros\u00c3\u00a9 the Riveter.\n A Ruth Bader Gin-sberg.\n I did that one.\n You two have a good time.\n Have a good time.\n All right.\n (cell phone rings)\n Oh BOB (on cell phone): Hey, bub.\n What's the holdup?\n It's been six months since I gave you my blessing.\n When am I gonna hear my daughter cry?\n Huh?\n I think I deserve to hear my daughter cry.\n Bob, I'm proposing tonight.\n I've been planning on doing it all along - when we got back home to the loft.\n - The loft?\n You visit every possible romantic proposal spot on the planet, and you pick that dump?\n Because it's where we met, Bob.\n Look, I've got a whole plan.\n I haven't told anybody.\n So I mailed the ring from Europe.\n So when we're looking at the mail, I'll say, like, \"Check this one out.\n This one's from Turkey.\n You should open it, Jess.\n \" You mailed my grandmother's ring from Turkey?\n I hired an Au pair.\n He was going there, anyhow.\n - A male Au pair?\n - Yes, a boy Au pair.\n Look, look, I better get a phone call tonight with the news that my daughter - has a fianc\u00c3\u00a9.\n - Bob I don't even care if it's not you.\n Okay?\n - So you told Russell you're engaged.\n - (sighs)\n Well, that's simple.\n I'll just tell him that I'm engaged, so what was once interesting will now become commonplace.\n (groans)\n I'm so mad at myself.\n But he was hectoring me.\n I felt completely hectored.\n Forgot about \"hector.\n \" That's a good word, real good word.\n Which reminds me, um, may I hector you to pick a favorite?\n Hmm.\n Aw.\n Easy.\n - This one.\n - Oh, nice.\n - (scoffs)\n I have to fix this.\n - Okay.\n If Nick finds out that I told Russell we're engaged, he's gonna spin out, and he'll tell me he's fine, then I'll get a call a week later with him on a bus, crying somewhere, and he's gonna ask me to marry him.\n And then I'll never know if he wanted to marry me or if he just asked me 'cause I lied to my ex at a children's birthday party.\n - That was a lot.\n - You know what?\n I just need to march right up to Russell and I need to tell him the truth.\n - Yeah.\n - I can do that.\n - I've been to Europe.\n - (whoops)\n I can do anything.\n - Hey, Mr.\n Europe.\n - Hey, man.\n You know, I thought you were gonna propose for sure.\n - I was waiting for it.\n - Yeah.\n Uh?\n Look who it is.\n It's Mr.\n Sun.\n I tell you, I was sure (in slow-mo): that you were gonna pop the question.\n Instead, you just sent me a bunch of Instagram pictures.\n Pasta, bread, cheese, sorts of nonsense really.\n - I mean, I get it, you're in Europe.\n - You have to know that's disgusting.\n Relax.\n It'll soak in.\n No, not the sunscreen.\n The mustache.\n Your mustache is disgusting.\n - Stop touching it.\n - I'm rubbing it in.\n You're just doing the mustache.\n Just If you hate my mustache, sir, then you hate me.\n That's not true.\n I just don't like the mustache.\n It never would've happened if I was here!\n It never would've happened!\n Don't make this about the mustache!\n (giggling, whooping)\n CECE: Schmidt.\n Thank you.\n Yep.\n Mm-hmm.\n Uh, so, Timmy's mom just started climbing a tree with some very high heels and musical chairs is turning into an adult drinking game.\n -

BOTH: Wood.\n - Wood!\n See, I don't have anything!\n I knew it!\n I got nothing!\n (door slams)\n RUTH: I'm awake!\n Hey, I think Ruth is awake.\n You think, Winston?\n Wait, so, you're saying that you're doing Russell's busywork?\n That you, Jessica Day, former principal of an entire school, is doing his busywork?\n Nah, girl.\n Nah, hold up.\n One sec.\n How's that wine and coffee combination treating you?\n My heart is beating really fast, but time is moving really slow, \n - so it all kind of evens out.\n - Hmm.\n Wait, why are you quitting?\n He has a couple guys he trusts, and I just get left out of all the major decisions.\n - Typical.\n - Heads up, you're putting sugar in your wine.\n I made a boo-boo.\n Let's just No, I made a yum-yum.\n -

Every woman has a \"Tuesday meeting\" they haven't been invited to.\n How many times in your life have you been excluded from something important or talked over or ignored because you're the only woman in the room?\n It was different when I was running my own company, but ever since we joined with GKM, I've had to start dealing with this male-pattern dumbness.\n (pumping)\n MAN: Ugh.\n - What is that?\n - It's a breast pump, Ken.\n I said I needed time to pump, and you refused to change the meeting, so here we are.\n Now, for the jeans campaign.\n Which one of these guys says, \"I'm having fun in Toronto\"?\n (pumping continues)\n So, for half an hour, they had to sit there and watch me get milked like a freaking cow.\n Oh, yeah, your nipples looked like pizza bagels in that thing.\n Yeah, they do.\n You know what?\n This is not the first time \n - I've been left out of a Tuesday meeting.\n - Mm-hmm.\n Remember my first job in administration?\n The budget's still too high.\n You know, I think it might be the number of field trips we've been going on?\n What about the number of field trips?\n Yes, exactly.\n - Great idea.\n - I literally just said that.\n I think we're gonna need to take it out of the transportation budget.\n Here's a crazy idea.\n What if we take it out of the transportation budget?\n MEN (chanting)\n: Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben!\n I've been left out of Tuesday meetings -

I don't want to hear this.\n - WINSTON: Here we go.\n Oh, never mind, that's a maze you drew.\n Yeah, you drew a maze then couldn't solve it.\n You went straight for the wall.\n It was a hard maze.\n This one is just a list of words that rhyme with \"moon.\n \" But then right away, it's \"bun.\n \" \"Moon, spoon, loon, bun\"?\n The heck is this?\n There was no other words that rhymed with \"moon.\n \" - \"Tune\"?\n - That's what I'm saying.\n I don't have a Pepperwood was all that I had.\n I've got nothing.\n You're Mr. Diarrhea Head.\n Please don't say that to me right now.\n I'm going through a thing right now, so please don't say that to me.\n I'm asking you, please don't call me that.\n Okay, Mr. Diarrhea Head.\n No, you're the Diarrhea Head.\n Okay?\n Schmidt, what would you like me to do here?\n What do you want from me?\n What am I supposed to do?\n Uh, you used to love fixing my life.\n Before (grunts)\n came around.\n SCHMIDT: It's different times.\n I got to wipe her butt.\n I got to wipe my butt.\n I can't wipe your butt, too.\n Can I get in on that?\n Never mind.\n That's it, I'm done.\n I'm calling Merle, and I'm telling him I don't have any ideas.\n Ruth, honey, will you please watch Uncle Nick while Uncle Winston and I have a conversation?\n Fine.\n Follow me.\n I'll follow you if I want to follow you.\n - Let's go.\n - Okay.\n I'm coming.\n If anyone's the boss between us, it's me.\n - RUTH: I'm the boss.\n - (door closes)\n You know something, I used to think that Nick was the Guttenberg, but it turns out he may be the little lady.\n Winston, I need you to focus here.\n We have a spiraling man on our hands.\n We just need to remind him that he has good ideas.\n Do we have any other idea notebooks?\n Because this is just nonsense.\n I read it, and I don't want to be friends with him anymore.\n Maybe it doesn't have to be his writing.\n - It could be from anything.\n - Hmm.\n - Just find something.\n - You know what, yes.\n Yes.\n Um Okay.\n Here we go.\n \"All reactionaries are paper tigers.\n \"In appearance the reactionaries are terrifying, but, in reality, they are not so powerful.\n \" -

Uh, because he cared.\n - Why?\n - I don't really know, but he did.\n - Why?\n - Before you, I was his baby girl.\n\n\n\n WINSTON: Nick.\n Look what we just found.\n A forgotten masterpiece.\n You've got to hear this.\n You've still got it.\n \"All reactionaries are paper tigers.\n \"In appearance the reactionaries are terrifying, \"but in reality, they are not so powerful.\n \" And that?\n That's just the beginning.\n I mean, I don't remember writing it.\n It does sound like something I would write.\n Just think about it.\n You're always saying stuff like, \"In reality, they are not so powerful.\n \" - In terms of the reactionaries.\n - Ha ha!\n - I wrote that?\n - Check that out, man.\n That's you.\n - That's crazy.\n - Let me take a peek at that.\n You just need to believe in yourself, Nick.\n You've still got it.\n It's powerful.\n It's v-very it's-it's powerful stuff.\n Well, I think it's pretty clear.\n I'm back, boys.\n -

I just wanted to say - No, I wanted to say that this morning I was ready to quit.\n Wait, you're gonna quit?\n But I decided not to, because I know I can really make a difference for these schools if you will let me.\n I know I was wrong about the meeting, but you have to admit, you haven't given me any real work to do.\n - That's true.\n - Why is that?\n Do you not think of me as an equal?\n Because if that's the case, that needs to change.\n No, that's not it at all.\n Jess, it's just that you're new here, and I've got a lot of trust issues.\n Probably from my third wife, Jackie.\n In fact, we were just discussing it in the divorced dad Wait, I thought your fourth wife was named Jackie.\n I married two women named Jackie.\n - Back-to-back?\n - Yeah.\n They were related.\n It's complicated.\n Look, I got to make this right.\n I hired you because I feel like you're exactly the right person to get stuff done around here.\n So I guess it's time for me to just let go and let you do that.\n You won't regret it.\n - All right.\n - Also, while we're here talking, we need some tampons in the bathroom.\n Are you asleep?\n No.\n Well I give up.\n This is my reality.\n I'll never sleep again.\n Tell me a story, Uncle Nick.\n Me?\n No, no, no.\n I don't have any stories, Ruth.\n Come on, Nick, you can do it Please?\n Nick, she asked for a story.\n - Why don't you tell her a story?\n - I thought you wanted - to sleep, Schmidt.\n - I don't know how to do that anymore.\n I've pushed through.\n - My body doesn't know how to sleep.\n - All right, fine, Ruth, you want a story?\n Here's a story.\n There was once a magical bear, and he, uh I don't know, walked on a magical tightrope to Seattle.\n Have you ever seen a magical bear?\n - No.\n - Is there a tightrope to Seattle?\n Not that I know of, Ruth.\n - Ugh, this is garbage.\n - Well, what do you want from me?\n It's late at night, you asked for a story that's the best that came out.\n Weren't you ever little like me, Uncle Nick?\n Of course I was little like you.\n Don't you know anything?\n I was born on a cold, lonely street on the South Side of Chicago.\n As rumor has it, and there's no proof of this, obviously, but I delivered myself.\n It was my fifth birthday party, there was a knock at the door.\n My father jumped up, gave us all a thumbs-up, gave me a wink, then he jumped out the window, \n - bounced up, took off running.\n - Oh, wow I didn't see him for six months.\n My only babysitter at the time was a rollercoaster at a local amusement park.\n That and a pack of cigarettes.\n (chuckles wryly)\n Being nine in Chicago is different.\n The tree fell, hit the power line, and the power line fell right on the hobo, shocking the hobo back to life.\n - That was an amazing moment.\n - (whispers): Hey.\n I don't know, it made me question the existence of God.\n I believed entirely in fate, and it was that same fate that brought me to the woman I love today.\n Uh, Nick, go back.\n Uh, what happened to the hobo?\n He stood up, he spun around, he said, \"Time to get a job,\" and he walked away.\n - Why don't you write it down, Nick?\n - About the hobo?\n - WINSTON: Yeah.\n - Yeah, why not?\n Oh, this is good.\n This is really good.\n We did it, Schmidt.\n (chuckles)\n (snoring)\n Schmidt?\n (continues snoring)\n (whispers): Oh, my God.\n Time to go to bed, my friend.\n Yeah, I think the coffee's wearing off.\n - I have to thank you so much for today.\n - (yawning)\n Uh-huh.\n Even though now I have so much work to do.\n Yeah, you're gonna kill it.\n It's gonna be great.\n I love you.\n I do love you.\n - Thanks, girl.\n -

I know, but what \n - No further questions.\n You guys, this is crazy.\n Look at this beautiful, impressionable child.\n Lillypads is the key to Ruth's future.\n If she gets into Lillypads, she gets into Willows.\n If she gets into Willows, she gets into Harvard.\n And if she gets into Harvard, \n - it's a bullet train to the Oval Office.\n - Hmm.\n Don't you want Ruth to be the president?\n Of course I do, but you can do it without going to some pressure cooker that turns her into a robot.\n (in robotic voice): Meep, meep, alphabet, meep, meep, numbers.\n Have you not seen Star Wars?\n Robots are helpful and -

but they look hot.\n - That sounds weird.\n - They did.\n - I hear you, I hear you.\n They looked super hot.\n Anyway, I have to run to work, so is there any chance that you could, you know, teach her how to draw a face, cut a circle, carry out a conversation Okay, fine.\n I'll do it, for Ruth.\n - BOTH: Yes.\n - Under one condition.\n - CECE: Sure.\n - You do it on my terms.\n What?\n I'm gonna have to go on a craft run, aren't I?\n I'm gonna need pipe cleaners, glitter, glue, finger paints and six different types of macaroni.\n And that's just 'cause I'm hungry.\n Honest to God, you don't already have all of that in this room already?\n I mean (sighs) Martini time.\n I like martinis.\n You know, I would be back to writing because I'm kind of in a nice flow, but, say, do you mind telling me that really interesting story you just told me about when you bought those shorts?\n I bought 'em.\n (laughs) A-And from the start of it, when you realized you needed new shorts?\n What was going on there?\n You just looked around your house and there weren't shorts?\n Not the fingers, man, I'm a writer.\n What are you doing here, coming up on me like a maniac?\n Um, it's me, Winston.\n Sorry, man, I'm just really edgy right now.\n - All right, man.\n - Working on this thing - about Chicago, actually.\n - Ooh.\n So you know it's gonna be raw.\n You know it's gonna be personal.\n - Oh, yeah.\n - Also, it doesn't exist.\n And if I don't have 20 pages by 3:00 today, \n - I'm gonna get punched in the face.\n - Who, your editor?\n No.\n Some guy I hired off Craigslist.\n Wait, so you hired a man to punch you in the face if you don't write 20 pages?\n Yeah.\n I have no idea what he looks like, either.\n You know, I would have punched you in the face for free.\n - Well, I got somebody.\n - Okay.\n Well, anyway, I have a real problem, one that I didn't bring on myself.\n - I'm just really slammed.\n - So, I'm a detective now and I have to testify in these trials.\n But you know I get rattled on the stand.\n Can you repeat the question?\n I asked you if you'd like me to repeat the question.\n Can you repeat the question?\n Can you have her repeat the question?\n - Let's dig in.\n - Thank you.\n When I was at law school, I-I learned that if somebody falls apart on the stand, it's mostly because they're hiding something.\n So, I guess my question to you, Detective, is: \n - what are you hiding?\n - Nothing.\n - Nothing?\n (laughs) \n - I have nothing to hide.\n Well, maybe not on this case, but perhaps you're hiding something from your past?\n Objection.\n Form of a question.\n Withdrawn.\n Isn't it true, Detective, that this could be the result of a guilty conscience?\n I have nothing to be guilty about.\n Ladies and gentlemen, are we buying this?\n 'Cause I'm not.\n My question is about the night of January 12.\n - Wait, what?\n No, no, no.\n No, no.\n - 2001.\n Nick, that is a cold case and I won't discuss it any further.\n Well, looks like we're discussing it now.\n I was not masturbateng!\n NICK: Easy, Winston.\n You just screamed \"masturbateng. \" \n -

Hi, Happy Sock.\n - Hi.\n JESS: See, Schmidt?\n We're not cutting circles; we're being circles.\n Right.\n Of course.\n Ruth can't hold a scissor, but now she can twirl around like a goon at a Phish show.\n Okay, well, now you're just napping.\n We're not napping, we're going on a brain exploration.\n I take that back, actually.\n Ruth is napping.\n Okay, well, that's enough, Jess.\n You're sending Ruth straight to Triangles.\n You hear that?\n (mimics a chicken) That's the schoolyard chickens.\n And they're and they're pecking at Ruth.\n And this time, they want her eyes.\n I need my eyes for TV.\n Oh, honey, don't you worry about a thing, okay?\n Daddy's gonna take over now.\n But the clock is a-ticking, so let's start with a drill.\n - No.\n No drills.\n - DRILL is an acronym.\n D: Do it.\n R: Redo it.\n I: Imitate what you just did.\n L: Learn to keep doing it.\n L: Live the rest of your life doing it.\n DRILL, DRILL, DRILL.\n Technically, that's an acrostic.\n (high-pitched): Sweet burn, Jess.\n Yeah.\n You got me.\n DRILL.\n SCHMIDT: And again.\n RUTH: Red, yellow, orange, green.\n And that is how you earn a dollar in America.\n (quietly): She's not your child, she's not your child Okay, Ruth, we're gonna do the colors one more time, and then, we're gonna move on to a section that I like to call \"Get the numbers right, and Daddy will give you a stuffed animal.\n \" SCHMIDT: Here we go.\n RUTH: Red, yellow, orange, Denise.\n - Yes.\n - SCHMIDT: I'm sorry.\n Uh Did you just call green \"Denise\"?\n Yes.\n The color's name is Denise.\n Well, I hope you're happy.\n The interview is in an hour, and now green is Denise.\n Green is whatever she wants it to be.\n (whispers): Green is whatever I want it to be.\n - Huh.\n - JESS: Green could be Denise or Juanita or Jerry.\n I just realized (laughs) - green is Jerry, for me.\n - Green is not Jerry for me.\n Are you and Aunt Jess in a fight?\n Oh, no, no, no.\n Uh, we're just telling stories.\n Uh, once upon a time, there was a fuzzy bunny who decided that colors didn't need names, and anything could be called anything, and the world descended into chaos.\n But the bunny was happy, because the bunny wasn't forced - into somebody else's definition of color.\n - Well, the fuzzy bunny wasn't really an authority, now, was she?\n Because she used to work at a school where instead of grades, they gave out rainbows.\n Bringing up the bunny's past is uncalled for in this cabbage patch.\n But the point is: I know about private schools, and the whole system is corrupt.\n Said the very fuzzy bunny.\n Until the Jewish carrot farmer brought down his mighty shovel.\n - The whole system is corrupt.\n - (door closes) - What's going on?\n - SCHMIDT: Your friend - is costing us Washington.\n - Why didn't you marry Shivrang?\n Ruth, is that coffee?\n - Yep.\n - Okay, there is a child here.\n I'm gonna take her to the bedroom right now so she can watch local news bloopers.\n I don't know why she likes them so much.\n They're blowing their big shot.\n Okay.\n All right honey, let's go.\n Bye, honey.\n Mm-hmm.\n Talk to you later.\n Bye, Ruth.\n Great job.\n SCHMIDT: Green is green.\n - You did this.\n You did this.\n - You did this.\n You did this.\n - You did this.\n - You did this.\n WINSTON: Are we still on this?\n When are you gonna let this go?\n When you come clean, Detective.\n There is nothing to come clean about.\n Wait, aren't you 11 pages away from getting punched in the face?\n Oh, just answer the question.\n Does or does not the evidence speak for itself?\n Do I need to refresh your memory, sir?\n I didn't phone ahead to warn you of my arrival.\n I just thought it would be fun to surprise you at college.\n WINSTON: It was fun.\n Well, it should have been fun.\n - NICK: A man in front of a computer - (echoes): No WINSTON: I was checking my EarthLink.\n NICK: With no pants on.\n WINSTON: You know my bottoms run hot!\n NICK: Tissues suspiciously close.\n WINSTON: They were Doug's.\n Lotion.\n One sock.\n Ashy elbows.\n Cold left foot.\n Look, why am I explaining this to you?\n You're the one who's supposed to be writing right now.\n You know what I figured out?\n You are a procrastinator.\n Said the pro-masturbator.\n You always procrastinate when something is important to you.\n And you know how I know?\n January 12, 2001.\n - Damn you.\n - You drove eight hours across the country to come see me at college, to ask me if I have seen A Bug's Life.\n - Oh - A Bug's Life.\n The weekend before your midterms.\n You son of a bitch!\n Big test, oh, yeah Focus.\n (chuckles) Oh, I got to pick that up.\n Whoa!\n It's been a while though, hasn't it?\n You should have appreciated the fact that your friend hitchhiked across the country to visit you.\n - (both laugh) \n - You're a procrastinator.\n You want to know why you procrastinate?\n I'll tell you.\n But you didn't give me a chance to answer.\n How am I supposed to answer if not given the chance?\n - Fine.\n Answer.\n - It's a vague question.\n It's not a vague question.\n Why do you procrastinate?\n - I don't know.\n - Nick, you procrastinate when something is important to you, because deep down, you're don't think you're good enough to get it done.\n (laughing): That's the dumbest thing I've It's also that's possibly true, because that really feels like what I do when I Keep going, you're in a good zone.\n So, of course, when you actually get the opportunity to write something about your own life, the first thing you do is choke.\n You know how I know?\n Well, because for some reason, I'm your oldest friend.\n So I hope you get punched in the face today.\n I really do.\n And then maybe, you'll finally see that you are good enough to be everything you want to be.\n You masturbated one time.\n I swear to God, Nick.\n If I wasn't kicked off of Craigslist Schmidt, you look like you're gonna be sick.\n Remember, they've only been on the planet for three years.\n Oh, God.\n Is that kid reading Jonathan Franzen?\n Wow, this place is like the frickin' Louvre.\n There's a kid handing out mints in the bathroom.\n Well, then, why'd you come?\n To see your liberal snowflake - hippie trash handiwork?\n - No.\n I came for Ruth.\n And in silent protest against institutions such as this hellhole.\n But it's quicker to say \"for Ruth.\n \" - You are a queer little woman.\n - Guys, tighten up.\n All right?\n They started assessing us the minute we parked the car.\n - Xiawuhao.\n - What?\n That's \"good afternoon\" in Mandarin.\n Just a little amuse-bouche for the judges.\n I also brought an actual amuse-bouche.\n It's a crostini with burrata and tomato.\n Doesn't that sound yummy, Schmidt?\n Back off, Benjamin.\n Your burrata doesn't scare me.\n - (laughs) I think it does.\n - It kind of scares me.\n Ruth, just ignore them.\n You're gonna do great in there, okay?\n Feeling good?\n Meow.\n Ha!\n She just said \"meow.\n \" (both laugh) MISS CARLY: Okay.\n Kids, you can go inside.\n And parents, you'll be watching from a two-way mirror, which was a generous gift from a family that's too powerful to name.\n (whispers): It's Tate Donovan.\n - Oof.\n - All right.\n Let's go.\n - Let's hit it.\n - Okay, you ready, honey?\n Remember what we talked about.\n ROYGBIV.\n Red, orange, yellow Schmidt, she's got it.\n Okay?\n You're gonna do great in there.\n You're gonna bring the heat, aren't you, Ruth?\n Ruth gonna do what Ruth gonna do.\n -

ALY: Oh (crunching) \n - No spray bottle (spits) \n - Those are cat teeth.\n - Cat teeth.\n - (gags) \n - Cat teeth.\n - You can tell cat teeth by taste?\n - Yup!\n - Meow, meow, meow, meow \n - Cat world $71,000?\n It happened when I got my first huge Pepperwood check.\n Coach wanted to open up a gym and-and I wanted to help.\n All right, that checks out Only it wasn't a gym, it was a restaurant, \"Coach's Jim.\n \" J-I-M.\n It was a Ruth's Chris situation.\n They went bankrupt before they even opened.\n - My money was gone.\n - What?\n Coach's Jim?\n What kind of cuisine did they serve?\n And who's Jim?\n And why did Coach own him?\n Anyway, I don't need to know all of it.\n Let's just, let's just get back to Furguson, okay?\n I can't because this feels so good getting that off my chest.\n I need to tell you everything.\n No, I don't need to know everything.\n I know, but I want to.\n Here's the thing this is one that's been bogging me down for a very long time.\n Sometimes I wear my boxers backwards on purpose because I really like the snugness in the front, but I also really like the ventilation in the back.\n That's right, I'm smushed like a fat kid's nose up against the glass of a candy store window.\n (coughs) That felt really good to get off my chest.\n What else?\n What else?\n What else?\n What else?\n What else?\n What about this scenario?\n What if I died jumping in front of a bullet with Ruth's name on it?\n I know, unthinkable scenario.\n But what if?\n And what if she's president at the time, then I've saved the president and our daughter.\n Double hero.\n You know what?\n Just pick a number you're comfortable with.\n Okay?\n A hundred years?\n I'd wait a hundred years, okay?\n - Not okay.\n Not long enough.\n - Are you kidding me?\n We'd both be dead of natural causes.\n Perhaps the correct answer would be for eternity, forever.\n I don't need to know all of this.\n Let's just get back to Furguson, back to the memorial.\n No, Jess, because you don't keep any secrets, so I don't want to keep any.\n - Well - Jess, you are always 100% honest.\n So it's important that I am, too.\n - I mean - No, I want to tell you everything.\n I don't want any skeletons on our shoulders.\n There's one skeleton for me.\n - You have a secret?\n - Yeah.\n - Jessica Day has a secret.\n - Don't make fun.\n What, did you eat corn on the cob without the little holders?\n It's actually very emotional for me.\n (mocking): Oh, it is?\n What was your big lie?\n Let's hear it.\n I killed Furguson.\n That's why I've spent so much time on this memorial.\n One year ago, I killed Winston's cat.\n (crowd applauds) Uh, next up, we have Nicholas Miller and Jessica Day coming up to read a special Furguson poem.\n Nick and I will be performing a series of rhyming couplets about our friend Furguson.\n - (applause, whooping) - All right!\n (clears throat) Furguson was a good cat, yes, indeed.\n Many cat lessons from his life you should heed.\n With his proud lion mane and his big fluffy tail I mean, you think you know somebody.\n JESS: He ate all his food, even if it was stale.\n Struttin' around with his smushed little snout.\n He loved playing games and he loved hiding out.\n I think I still got teeth in my teeth.\n Like the time that he hid in the bag we brought burgers in.\n I just can't believe my girlfriend killed Furguson.\n (crowd gasps) Nick.\n What?\n Did I say it?\n Did I say the bad thing?\n I'm sorry, it just kind of came out.\n (sniffles) What the man says is true.\n A year ago, I killed a complicated and beautiful cat named Furguson.\n (crowd gasps) I'm so sorry, Winston.\n I didn't know how to tell you.\n NICK: She's not a bad person.\n She just did a bad thing.\n Don't try to save me, Nick.\n (Jess clears throat) I was catsitting at the loft and I was doing crafts that involved glitter.\n There was a glitter sale at Kraftwerk the store, not the German band from the '80s.\n And I spilled a bowl of purple, and Furguson took a bite.\n And an hour later, Winston came to pick him up.\n And the next day, he died.\n None of this rhymes.\n I did a cat murder!\n I'm so sorry.\n Aw, Jess, come on.\n DUNSTON: Let's, uh, keep this thing moving.\n Next up, we have, uh uh, Robby.\n (applause) Uh Well, I was gonna do an interpretive dance as the red laser dot that Furguson loved so much, but it feels a little inappropriate in the current climate.\n Um - I'm so sorry, Winston.\n - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jess, calm down.\n I talked to a cat psychic, she said he's in a good place.\n But then she also said he's with the cat from Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and I know that cat's a puppet.\n So I don't know how reliable she is.\n I'm just so sorry, and can you ever forgive me?\n Jess, Furguson died of a heart attack.\n - What?\n - Yes.\n The coroner said nothing about glitter.\n Did you say \"coroner\"?\n Yeah, I had a coroner check him out.\n It was quite possibly the most bizarre of my small-time abuses of police power.\n Oh, please let that be true.\n My stomach has been a brick for a year now.\n - I had to go on probiotics.\n - Jess, it's true.\n I was with Furguson when he passed.\n We were in the kitchen.\n - Go on.\n Tell us.\n Let it out.\n - (sighs) So there I was, in the kitchen toasting a bagel.\n Furguson was on the counter, just watching.\n You can imagine what a human toasting a bagel must look like to a cat: pretty crazy.\n - Really crazy.\n - Yeah.\n So there he was, just watching me, you know.\n And, um And then he got this look on his face.\n And then he stepped back a little.\n And it was in that moment that I knew something was wrong.\n And then he looked away, and, uh And that was it.\n He was gone.\n I feel like I'm living this moment.\n Oh, and then the bagel was burning, so I had to throw that in the trash.\n - (chuckles) \n - That didn't get him?\n What?\n Shh.\n (quietly): You hear that?\n Hear what?\n I hear a meow.\n - You hear a meow?\n - Shh!\n Oh, God, he's not gonna cry, he's gonna go insane.\n Wait, wait, wait.\n I-I'm sorry I'm hearing something.\n I hear a cat, and it is in distress.\n There is a cat in the building, and it needs me!\n Meow!\n Thank you.\n Please don't look over there.\n - (Winston meowing) - No reason to watch a grown man lose his mind.\n - Thank you.\n - Thanks for having me.\n You have a really beautiful home.\n WINSTON: Meow!\n Meow, meow, meow!\n Here, kitty cat.\n You're a baby covered in hair This is the voice I used to use to make Furguson come to me.\n Honey, are you sure you're hearing a cat?\n 'Cause, you know, maybe it's just a little \n\n\n\n - voice in \n - Baby, it's a cat.\n Okay?\n I know a meow when I hear one.\n Guys, can you help us \"look for the cat,\" so I can talk to Winston?\n Good call.\n Jess and I will check the back office.\n Kitty, Kitty, where are you?\n Oh, look!\n Cat poop.\n Uh, it's still warm.\n (mouthing) Do you want to take a break from looking \n - for a fake cat?\n - Yes.\n I hid something in here when I used to own the place.\n Check this.\n Aw, it's still here.\n - Ah-ha-ha!\n - Ah-ha-ha.\n Hey, I'm so sorry I lied about Furguson.\n I just I didn't want you to look at me differently.\n Can I be honest?\n I think it's kind of hot that you kept that as a secret.\n - Really?\n - Yeah.\n Jessica Day, a murderer?\n Keeping murder a secret?\n Am I attracted to murderers?\n Well, it turns out I didn't kill him, so But if you did, I want you to know that I'd I'd help you bury the body.\n You know that, right?\n Weirdly, yes, I do.\n I do know that.\n 'Cause it could wake up, and if it did, I would just hit it over the head with a shovel and then just keep burying it in the hot desert sand.\n Wait, why are we going all the way out to the desert?\n What's wrong with the woods?\n Well, only psychos bury stuff in the woods, Jess.\n But listen, the reason I didn't tell you I lent Coach money was, I was afraid that one of the reasons we broke up in the past was 'cause I was bad at money, \n - and I didn't want to scare you off.\n - Nick.\n Nothing you could do would scare me off.\n We're in this together.\n Cat murder and all.\n Well, there's nothing that you could do that would make me love you any less.\n You know you need to fix things with Coach.\n Yeah.\n Cat!\n Where you at?\n Okay, you know what?\n Here's my new scenario.\n (groans) \n - I'm in the Merchant Marines \n - Stop it.\n I only blurted out \"three years\" because I don't even want to think about you being gone.\n I don't know what I would do without you.\n I would end up dragging a lawn chair out to your grave on the Fourth of July and lighting a sparkler, and Ruth wouldn't want to come with me because she would say \"Mommy, Kevin's having a party, and I don't want to go to the grave again.\n \" Okay?\n So I'm just alone, on a chair, and I miss you.\n I don't want you alone at my grave.\n That sounds terrible.\n I want you to be with your new husband at my grave.\n I want you to find someone who's gonna take care of you, who's gonna love you as much as I do.\n I just want you.\n Well, it's too late for that.\n I-I'm dead.\n - No.\n - It's a waste of time.\n I might as well be \n - at the bottom of the ocean.\n - Stop.\n You have to move on.\n Uh, hey, Dunston.\n - Uh Hey.\n - Hey, can you come here for a sec?\n - You were great tonight, by the way.\n - Oh, thank you.\n You did a very good job under difficult circumstances.\n Thank you very much.\n So I'm gonna die, and I need you to take care of my wife.\n Super.\n We're fine.\n Thank you.\n - Okay.\n - (laughing): Okay.\n Should I join in or just watch?\n What exactly are we doing here?\n Who wants to begin?\n I mean (sighs) I'm not even mad about the money.\n I'm just mad that Coach and I never talk anymore.\n COACH: What are you talking about, man?\n I called and asked you if elephants are basically pigs, and you were like \"no,\" and I was like \"cool.\n \" Yeah, and that was an awesome conversation.\n It was also three years ago, man.\n We haven't talked since.\n I mean, honestly, I'd pay another $70,000 to have my friend back.\n I feel like we're close.\n Let's bring it home.\n I guess I just stopped talking to you 'cause I was embarrassed.\n NICK: Embarrassed with me?\n You've seen me trip after a shower and rug burn my penis on a towel.\n (laughing): Classic Nick.\n - It really burned.\n - It was so scabby.\n - NICK: Yeah.\n - COACH: It scabbed up like crazy.\n - Yes, it did.\n - Like a grilled shrimp.\n Like grilled jumbo shrimp.\n Eh.\n I'm gonna pay you back, man.\n No matter how long it takes.\n I promise.\n And to prove it to you, I brought $5,000 as your first installment.\n You brought it in cash?\n Why is everyone so cavalier about large sums of money?\n You just dropped, like, $600.\n I can hear him.\n Don't worry, cat.\n I'm coming to save you.\n ALY: Winston, Winston!\n Stop it.\n Babe.\n Babe, sit down, sit down.\n Winston.\n Baby, I love you, but these meows are in your head.\n Okay?\n It's because you haven't cried over Furguson yet, and not letting yourself have a good cry has made you a little doy-doy.\n You know (strumming lips) It's made you really dumb and stupid, and you're not those things.\n Now is the time to let it all out.\n Right now, Winston.\n You don't have to try to be strong for me.\n (crying) Wow, those sinuses swelled up fast.\n (screaming) My cat, my cat, my cat.\n You know, it didn't hit me at first, and then, by the time that it did, you were already pregnant, and I just wanted to be I wanted to be the rock for this family.\n Baby, if there's one thing I know for sure, it's that I'm the rock in this family.\n Yeah, but if you're the rock, then what am I?\n You're the beautiful flower sprouting out from the rock.\n - I like flowers, so - I know you do, buddy.\n - WINSTON: Yeah.\n - Oh, buddy.\n - Hey, buddy.\n - Hey, buddy.\n - Hey, buddy.\n - Hey, buddy.\n Oh, I like it when y'all call me \"buddy.\n \" It's nice.\n Also, you can stop looking for the cat.\n I don't want to blow you guys' minds, but, uh it ain't real.\n SCHMIDT: What?\n The cat isn't real?\n That's a This is all so Shyamalanian.\n I guess I just been keeping things bottled up \n -

You found my cat.\n - Well Oh, that's the bartender's bar cat.\n I'm sorry, but, uh, that cat's gone.\n - Give me my cat back.\n - JESS: Wait.\n Um, what if we were to offer you $5,000 in cash for the cat?\n Oh, yeah, then, totally.\n That'd be fine.\n $5,000.\n Curious, what's the lowest amount you would have taken for that cat?\n I don't know, maybe, like, uh, 50 bucks?\n - $50.\n - Yeah.\n - That's considerably less than $5,000.\n - Oh, yeah.\n Here you go.\n I think I'm gonna name him NAFTA.\n - ALL: Aw!\n - I don't like it.\n His name's actually Mitzi.\n - ALL: NAFTA!\n -

For a little while.\n - Or a long while.\n Who knows?\n JESS: Judith is gonna be here any minute, and I need you to test me.\n I looked up \"cute dog\" on the Internet, and I printed out a bunch of images, so I just need you to shove a cute dog in my face until I find something disgusting about it.\n I can do that.\n Oh.\n He's so teeny tiny that he fits in his food bowl.\n And he climbed in.\n He wiggled around.\n (laughs): He knocked all his food out.\n Which sucks, because there are so many starving people in the world.\n - Next dog.\n - Now we're talking.\n Good.\n I know what I hate, but I'm not sure what you're gonna hate.\n JESS (laughs): Oh, my God.\n I want to like this little lug.\n Jess, what do you hate about this dog?\n She's wearing a princess costume, which enforces gender stereotypes in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable.\n Next dog.\n I hate to do this one to you.\n No.\n No.\n No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n What do you dislike strongly?\n Is this guy rocking a jean jacket?\n Unfortunately, yes.\n I don't hate that!\n -

Do they look flat to you?!\n - (muffled grunting) Do they look flat to you?!\n She tried to jam the business end of a drumlet straight up my tuchus.\n And then things got worse.\n I can only describe what I experienced next as anti-Semitic.\n Hey, gefilte face!\n Quit playing \"Where's My Foreskin?\" and get in here and rub my feet before I divorce your Yentl-loving, Ashkenazi ass!\n (sighs) I knew this day would come, but just thought I had more time.\n Schmidt, you're being crazy, man.\n Just go talk to your wife about this.\n I can't do that.\n My only option is to knock her up and then disappear into the night.\n I'm gonna need you and Nick to take care of my family while I'm in hiding.\n Hey, be honest with her.\n Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to stare at my tongue in the mirror.\n So, as you can see, we have lots of toys - for Mario to play with.\n - (toy squeaking) And it looks like he's found one he enjoys.\n Look at that.\n (sniffles) - Good for him.\n - Can I just say, I had some serious doubts about you getting a dog from us after what happened last time.\n You had a real Of Mice and Men vibe.\n Did I?\n (laughs) I mean, who gets emotional - over how cute a dog is, right?\n (laughs) - Oh.\n People with something missing inside of them?\n (both laugh) Will you excuse me a minute?\n Mm-hmm.\n - Hi, cutie.\n (chuckles) \n - (Mario whimpers) Annabelle, you got to help me out.\n Mr.\n Miller, in 30 minutes, I'll have a barstool and a high chair.\n I might be able to get you a table, but I can't guarantee that your mariachi band is gonna hang around.\n - (beep) \n - I'm so sorry.\n Can you please hold?\n Come on, Miller.\n Bob, I don't have time for this.\n - Clock's ticking, bub!\n - I know.\n But the hostess just offered me a barstool and a high chair, \n -

Cannot drink it, so I'm gonna pour it.\n - (chuckles) CECE: Hey, Schmidt.\n It's getting a little late.\n Maybe we should, you know, move along to that second location.\n (sighs) Cecilia I have something I need to say to you.\n Okay.\n Um first, let me say what an amazing mother and woman and partner you are.\n And deep down, I truly do I truly do believe that you are a good person.\n A good person who likes Jews.\n - You like Jews just fine.\n - Schmidt?\n I'm nervous about us getting pregnant again.\n You are?\n Why?\n Because your temperament while pregnant is, um Wish I had the words.\n - Winnie.\n - Hmm?\n - He have the words for you?\n - The words he used were - \"constant terror.\n \" - Why would you repeat that?\n Well, 'cause you know I'm scared of Cece.\n Well, I'm sorry.\n I'm sorry if I was a little bit moody while I was creating life with my body.\n Aly, can you believe this?\n - Well - Well?\n Okay, d-don't be mad, but I have never, ever seen anyone be pregnant the way that you were pregnant.\n So much so that, for evidence, I decided to capture it on my phone.\n CECE (on phone): What genius got us a Jolly Jumper?\n Who got us the Jol Okay, Vandana Auntie, way to go.\n You see, we already have a Jolly Jumper.\n So put the tuna salad down.\n Put it down!\n Tuna salad is for people who use the registry.\n Boo!\n Everybody boo.\n - Why are you not booing?!\n - I honestly don't \n - remember that.\n - Oh, it's okay, Cecilia.\n\n\n\n Also, thanks for having my back, Aly.\n Whoa.\n I do not have your back.\n Yeah, I've also never seen someone pregnant the way you were pregnant.\n You were a coddling, blubbering mess.\n Aly, come closer, I want you to capture the luminescence \n - of Cece's hair.\n - Shut up and keep brushing.\n You are a lifemaker.\n You have the jewel of life inside of you.\n Cece, what do you need?\n I'll get you anything you need.\n You'll never have to move again.\n That was hard for me to watch.\n - Uh, I was unbearable.\n - Yeah, we both were.\n (chuckles) Hate to see if you had any videos of me \n - in that phone, which you don't \n - I do.\n Mountie costume!\n JUDITH: Since this is a fourth-floor loft, will you be creating a fire plan with Mario?\n We'd love his input.\n She means yes.\n Man, you got a lot of questions, Judith.\n And if you were on a walk with Mario and you encountered a coyote, what would you do?\n I'd run away.\n (chuckles) \n - He's joking.\n - No.\n I mean, what I would do is I'd pick up Mario, and then I'd run away.\n And who would take Mario if your relationship were to end?\n Oh, thank God.\n That's an easy one.\n I would take him.\n - If we break up, I'd take him.\n - What?!\n - You think we're gonna break up?\n - I didn't say No, no, no, no.\n JUDITH: You know what?\n I actually I missed a question.\n How do you feel about pee pads?\n JESS: So in your vision of the future, we break up, you get to take Mario, and I'm left alone with some poop bags?\n - What are poop bags?\n - They're the bags that you put the dog's poop in.\n Why would you put dog poo in bags, Jess?\n It was a hypothetical question.\n But you answered it so quickly.\n Because I thought we were trying to rush Judith.\n We were.\n I just didn't think you'd be able to answer that question so easily.\n I mean, do you see us breaking up?\n No, I don't want to break up ever.\n I just \n - (phone ringing) Hold on.\n Sorry.\n - Who is that?\n It's just the restaurant we're having dinner tonight, okay?\n - It's no big deal.\n - Look, I know this might not be the most convenient time to talk about this, but we're about to become parents to a dog, and I need to know we're on the same page.\n We are on the same page.\n I'm really sorry.\n - I have to answer this one.\n - You need to take a phone call when I'm telling you how I feel about our relationship?\n You know what?\n Let me take that phone call.\n Hello?\n Annabelle from Beso.\n Well, we're not coming.\n Okay.\n Bye.\n Where were we?\n - You know what's crazy?\n - Mm.\n Even after seeing all those videos, I still want to have another baby with you more than anything else in the whole wide world.\n Me, too, more than anything.\n Things are gonna be so different this time.\n I'm gonna give you so much space.\n I'm gonna be so pro-Semitic, that little beanie you wear on the top of your head is gonna spin.\n Feels like a rough start, but I appreciate the effort.\n - Let's go to the hotel.\n - We're never gonna make it there and back in time to relieve the babysitter.\n You know what?\n I know someplace on the way.\n There's no way that they're home.\n Nick is keeping those dinner reservations, I guarantee it.\n I didn't know when and I didn't know why, but I knew that one day I'd be having sex in this loft again.\n I hope Winston's room still has that exercise bike in it.\n - I have an idea.\n - Mm.\n You wouldn't think that woman would have a urinal in her bathroom.\n No, I can't go out looking like this.\n - I can't stay in looking like this.\n - Uh What?!\n No!\n You seeing this?!\n I ain't got no sense of fashion.\n You weren't gonna tell me?\n - I did, many times.\n - Then why didn't you leave me?!\n I did, when you bought those banana-yellow bird pants, but I came back because I love you just a little more than I hate those pants.\n (chuckles) Why-why are you taking them off?\n I just missed seeing your face with my own eyes.\n Look, I know there's a lot of beautiful things that I have not seen, but nothing in this world will make me take my eyes off of you.\n Why are you so sweet to me?\n - (Winston chuckles) - Mm.\n But we only have these for a few more hours, and I want you to see as much as you can, babe.\n All right, what's next?\n I want to see some classic movies in color: Citizen Kane, Schindler's List Ooh, I got bad news for you.\n (chuckles) This is a surprise.\n A real slobber goblin tonight, huh?\n What are you talking about?\n - Cece?\n - What?\n We are not alone in this bed.\n - (both screaming) \n - (Mario barking) \n - Aah!\n Whoa!\n Aah!\n Wait!\n - (Cece shrieking) No!\n - (shrieking) - No, no.\n Dog!\n - No!\n - Dog!\n Horny dog!\n That terrier attacked my sensitive area!\n Okay, how do you think I feel?\n You confused me for a dog.\n I've never seen a naked man before.\n Oh, what are you guys doing here?\n - Who are these people?\n - We're trying for another baby.\n Oh, my God.\n Congratulations!\n We're adopting a dog!\n No, you're not.\n I've had enough.\n I'm taking Mario.\n Wait!\n Don't take that dog.\n Jess deserves Mario.\n This woman is amazing.\n She's gonna love that dog so much that she's gonna pick up its poop and keep it in bags.\n -

Okay.\n - (Mario whimpers) Oh, my God.\n You got him.\n That was heroic.\n I mean, it was so stupid, but it really it was heroic.\n - Yeah.\n - Mario.\n I am so mad at you, but I love you.\n I mean, first you're running away from us, now you're happy to see us.\n You are all over the map, Mario Day-Miller.\n - (phone ringing) - I got to grab that.\n Is that my dad?\n Yes, yeah, your dad He, uh he calls me every time he he meets somebody from Chicago.\n I mean, he'll ask me, he'll go, \"Do you know Tim from Chicago?\n 'Cause he doesn't know you.\n \" And then I just say \"No,\" and then, yeah.\n That doesn't make any sense.\n My dad doesn't even like you.\n Well, that's what happens - Whatever.\n Who cares?\n - Wait.\n Beso's where we went on our first date.\n Did we?\n I'm restaurant blind.\n I don't remember restaurants.\n Okay, now, we got to get Mario back home before Judith remembers she wants to take him back.\n Let's go!\n Let's go!\n Wait.\n (gasps) Sweat back!\n Nick, you're lying to me.\n Oh, my God.\n Nick, this dinner were you gonna?\n Jess, I had been planning this for so long.\n I just wanted everything to be perfect.\n But it is perfect.\n I mean, it's us, so this is as perfect as it gets.\n Okay.\n (gasps) Is he about to?\n Oh, my God.\n Oh, my God.\n Oh, my God!\n All right.\n He's been keeping the engagement ring in a plastic bag.\n It's not even a Ziploc bag.\n It's just a generic plastic bag.\n (sighs) Jessica Day (laughs) will you marry me?\n Nick, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\n I want to raise this dog with you, and I want to have babies and eat good food and laugh and take care of each other.\n And I want it to start tonight.\n It's you and me.\n It's It's always been you and me.\n - Is that a \"yes\"?\n - Yes!\n Yes!\n She said yes!\n - I've had the time of my life \n - (Jess laughs) No, I never felt this way before Oh, USC's never getting these glasses back.\n - They can take my bone marrow.\n - (Aly laughs) (laughter) Okay, so who gets the dog if you get a divorce?\n ALL: Shut up, Judith!\n - Dad, I said yes!\n - I did it, Bob.\n Oh, I don't know why you spent so much of the story talking about that color-blind friend of yours, but I'm so happy!\n Dad, can you lean away?\n You're blowing out the speaker.\n - (sobbing) \n - Dad, are you okay?\n His reaction doesn't bode well for the speech at the wedding.\n What do you mean?\n - Cheers.\n - Cheers.\n Cheers to you, too.\n Oh.\n (crying)\n"}, {"title": "07x07 -

(cheering)\n - SCHMIDT: Okay.\n Oh, this is gonna be trouble.\n Good.\n Okay, so, uh, Nick and Jess asked the two of us to make a toast - the night before their wedding.\n - But Schmidty and Winnie don't roll like that.\n - Uh-oh.\n - So why toast BOTH: When we can roast?\n This is about to be really funny.\n Okay, let's start with Nick.\n Now, I don't want to say Nick here is a lazy piece of human garbage with a flat ass and the writing talents - of a brain-dead alcoholic.\n - (laughs)\n Because why state the obvious?\n (Schmidt and Winston laughing)\n Oh, my God.\n - Oh.\n - But in a real way, Nick sucks as a person, y'all.\n - SCHMIDT: That's right.\n - WINSTON: He really does.\n But more importantly, his writing - also sucks!\n - (laughs)\n You know what they say: you put a thousand monkeys in front of a thousand typewriters One of them will be Nick, and he'll probably be writing The Pepperwood Chronicles.\n (laughs)\n That's a dumb-ass book.\n Maybe this is our fault.\n We threw this wedding together so fast.\n And you did tell 'em to go hard.\n I did actually tell them to go \"hawd\" and to not get \"scurred,\" so th-that's where the confusion might be.\n - And that brings us to Jess.\n - Okay.\n Beautiful, big-eyed Jess who could have had any man she wanted in the whole wide world.\n - And still can.\n - And still can.\n - She still can.\n - Run!\n - WINSTON: Get your ass out.\n -

It is?\n (sighs)\n JESS: I'm getting married In the morning Even though it's later in the day Am I nervous?\n Maybe Damn, I forgot to invite Sadie Who knew my Uncle Elmer was gay?\n Hey, Jess, I'm gonna take Mario for a little walk.\n I'll see you on the other side of the aisle.\n I'd ask you for a kiss, but I don't want to mess with the curse.\n Well, that curse can kiss my ass, and you can kiss my face.\n That's very funny, but the swearing will end when we're married.\n -

What?\n No.\n It is entirely Schmidt's fault.\n - This is not a funny man.\n Doesn't matter.\n Look, we want to make it up to you, so if there's anything that we can do, please just l-let us know.\n - Our marriage is cursed.\n - Wh-What do you mean, cursed?\n Last night I seduced Jess at the, uh, rehearsal dinner.\n I dangled my hot body in front of her, and she couldn't resist, and we had a night of weird, wild sex that would have made the good Lord proud, and now our marriage is cursed.\n Come on, man.\n None of that stuff is true.\n Curses aren't real.\n Yeah, but you believe in crystals, Winston.\n Crystals are real, dude.\n Don't say nothing bad about crystals!\n Merle said he's not publishing Chicago Hobo, \n - and then a bird pooed on me.\n - SCHMIDT: What do you mean, \n - he won't publish it?\n - Where's the bird?\n I'll poo on him.\n Those two things happened back-to-back.\n That's a curse.\n Stop being such a goy boy.\n You go find Merle, and you tell him that you are not writing another Pepperwood until he publishes Chicago Hobo.\n - You think it'll work?\n - I know so, okay?\n He's right over there.\n We believe in you.\n - You can do this.\n - I'm gonna do this.\n I'm gonna do it well.\n - Hell, yeah.\n - That's right.\n - (whoops)\n - Well, guess we fixed the toast.\n (indistinct chatter)\n Look at our boy, all grown up.\n Little disappointed about what we talked about.\n You know, you and I we make a good combination.\n - Winston and Schmidt.\n - Mm-hmm.\n - I set 'em up, you - And I set 'em up.\n All right.\n It looked good, man.\n How'd it go?\n Good, good, good.\n He told me to go to hell and that he's not gonna publish Pepperwood anymore, \n - and I basically lost my job, so \n - Mm.\n (slurps)\n Uh Curses are real, people!\n They are real!\n I got to go protect my bride.\n WOMAN: This is the oddest wedding.\n (groaning loudly)\n Oh, hey, Cece.\n Oh, I'm so mad about politics.\n Aah!\n Aly, you are having the baby, okay?\n - I know those labor eyes, sister.\n - Okay, fine.\n - I'm in labor.\n - I know!\n Why is this how we make more people?\n It's a terrible system.\n Oh, honey, we got to get Winston, \n - we got to get you to the hospital.\n - No, no, no.\n I don't want to go until after the wedding.\n Aah!\n Take me to drugs.\n Take me to drugs right now.\n There we go.\n All right, here we go.\n I don't want to scare you, but this is the easy part.\n - You feeling better?\n - Yeah, yeah.\n The fresh air's really helping.\n We're in a stairwell.\n Ugh.\n You must think I'm the worst for going elbow deep in the ganj.\n Nah.\n In fact, I was high for, well, all my weddings.\n Whatever gets you down the aisle.\n Well, I seduced Nick last night.\n I lured him into my bridal chambers, and now we're getting evicted, my eye looks like ground beef, and I cursed our marriage.\n - You believe in curses?\n - Not normally, but I just want to know that Nick and I are safe, and no cartoon anvil's gonna fall out of the sky and crush us to smithereens.\n Is that crazy?\n No, but maybe it's not signs and curses you're worried about.\n Maybe it's the relationship?\n I mean, maybe, deep down, you know you and Nick aren't right for each other.\n Wait, what?\n What are you running from?\n Here I am, sitting with an amazing, beautiful, smart woman on her wedding day, and she's stoned and wearing an eye patch, and sitting in a dank stairwell with her ex.\n You want to talk about signs, that's a sign.\n A sign of what?\n Don't marry Nick.\n Be with me.\n Jess.\n I love you.\n Oh, boy.\n Ooh, hey, honey.\n Hey, Ruth, is Aunt Jess here?\n - I really need to talk to her.\n - What's the password?\n WINSTON: Oh, the password.\n Oh, uh, yeah, it's - Ruth 1.\n - Wrong.\n - Ruth 2?\n - Wrong.\n - Ruth 3?\n - Wrong.\n - Don't do this to me, kid.\n - Wrong.\n Ruth, honey, just tell us where Aunt Jess is, okay?\n Sure, for a hundred bucks.\n - I ain't got that.\n - I've never been more proud of that I mean, this is my daughter.\n - Unbelievable.\n - Yeah.\n Ruth.\n Man to man, I need to talk to Jess.\n I need to know if she's okay.\n But they're not back there.\n They're on the stairs.\n - Who's \"they\"?\n - RUSSELL: Look.\n When you first started working, I thought I was gonna be fine, I was over it, and then the more time we spent with each other, it just all came rushing back.\n And you're choosing to tell me this now?\n We've been together literally every day \n - for the past week and a half.\n - Yeah.\n I shouldn't be telling you any of this, but I also know \n - that if I didn't, I'd regret it forever.\n - Russell, I am in love with Nick, 100%, okay?\n This is not puppy love.\n This is old-ass dog love.\n Do you remember your first date with Nick?\n You ran into me sign and I asked you both to write down what you meant to each other on the back of some valet ticket.\n You kept those?\n I think you should look at those before you get married.\n Neither of you were ever sure about this, not really.\n Not deep down.\n Jess, be with me.\n Let me give you the life you deserve.\n\n\n\n - Let me make you happy.\n - (door opens)\n - Let me make you dead, you son of a bitch!\n - Oh, Nick!\n - (shouts)\n - Oh!\n No!\n (shouts)\n (shouting)\n NICK: I'm gonna get you \n WINSTON: What you think you're doing, Russell, huh?\n Don't you have enough wives, you slut?\n - I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning!\n - Take that!\n I'm losing, I'm losing he's so slippery!\n He's like a dolphin!\n Wow, Jess.\n - That dress.\n You look so beautiful.\n - Thank you.\n But your eye.\n What happened to your eye?\n - No Oh.\n - Did this son of a bitch steal your eye?!\n - I'll kill you!\n - No, no, I hurt my eye, and then my mom gave me some of that sweet Portland bomb-a.\n Look, Nick, I love you.\n I have no feelings for Russell.\n But how could you not?\n He is so handsome!\n I mean, look at him!\n He's physically outstanding!\n And it's all my fault!\n Because I brought the curse on us!\n Did the curse make you more handsome?!\n - Yeah.\n - That's my question to you!\n - He is physically incredible!\n - Nick, please don't fight him.\n We both know you're gonna lose.\n - BOTH: Let's do this!\n - SCHMIDT: I got your back, man!\n - Let's do it!\n - Yeah, unlucky for you, I'm packin'.\n RUSSELL: Oh, yeah?\n I can take all three of you.\n I kick.\n I kick really high!\n You're all so bad at fighting!\n - Boys, what's the strategy?\n - We hit him, - then we hit his ass again!\n - Uh-oh, - I think he heard your strategy.\n - Nick, take your clothes off.\n - What?!\n Why?!\n - I just got your suit pressed.\n - Time-out.\n - Time.\n Time.\n Guys, guys, guys, guys, \n - Aly is in labor.\n - What?\n My baby's having my baby?\n My baby's having my baby!\n Are you okay?\n I love you so much.\n What if it comes out covered in all the gum \n - I've ever swallowed?\n - Baby, you'll be fine.\n - I'll call the doula.\n - The doula's at Lollapalooza.\n Please tell me one of you goons is sober enough to drive this \n - circus to the hospital.\n - Not me.\n I've been drinking all day.\n I only have one working eye!\n Well, I'll take you to the hospital.\n - Thank you.\n Thank you so much.\n - CECE: Great!\n Uh, we'll beat you up after the baby is born.\n Why would you say that?\n Babe, why is your crystal out?\n Were you fighting?\n Aly, Winston, you come with me.\n - (elevator bell dings)\n - Wait, everybody come.\n I forgot who we're dealing with.\n (tires screech)\n Hey, hey, hey!\n Hey, only Blaze drives the limo!\n (car horn honks)\n Damn, they said, \"Blaze, you gonna lose it.\n \" And I was like, \"Nah, it's too big.\n \" (chuckles)\n Are you holding it in?\n You got to hold it in.\n Don't want it to fall on the ground and get dirty.\n That's not how it works.\n I'm really nervous about what you don't know.\n Hey, are we positive that this hospital has a baby department?\n - I think so.\n - I hope so.\n Ooh, Dr.\n Silverstein.\n Good to see you.\n (indistinct chatter)\n Hey, Russell.\n Catch.\n Your sixth wife is out there somewhere.\n It's just not me.\n Good-bye, Jess.\n Good-bye, Russell.\n Hey, do the right thing and get us the most expensive thing on the registry.\n (chuckles)\n Drive.\n Sorry about your hand.\n - (groans)\n - At least we're in a hospital.\n - Does it hurt?\n - Definitely.\n - Russell is shockingly strong.\n - Yeah.\n Especially for a boy his age.\n I guess the curse is real.\n Yeah, we got evicted.\n A bird deuced on my shoulder.\n I say this with love, but your eye is trash.\n Merle went crazy and decided that a book about a hobo with electric ankles wasn't a home run.\n And now I'm out of a job.\n We don't have a home.\n I mean, we're cursed.\n - (laughs)\n It's kind of our thing.\n - Yeah, it is.\n I mean, even the first time I kissed you, you know, you were still dating Dr.\n Sam.\n And now here we are in a hospital waiting room, three miles away from our wedding.\n - Figures.\n Sounds like us.\n - Yeah.\n Hey, do you remember on our first date we wrote how we felt about each other on two valet tickets?\n Ah, Jess, I'm sorry.\n I was just scared to tell you how I really felt.\n I was scared, too.\n We've both been scared about so many things for so long, and you know what?\n I don't care about the past or the future.\n All that I care about is right now, right here, you and me.\n I just want to have a weird, wonderful life together.\n You know?\n I want to get married and I want to take care of you, and I don't even care about a stupid curse.\n Guys, guess what.\n - Oh, my God.\n - Is the baby here?\n No, Aly's only three centimeters.\n It's gonna be another 13 hours.\n Yeah, the doctor told me to run around and burn off some energy.\n I was not being helpful.\n I'm excited!\n (laughs)\n - Wait, where are you going?\n - WINSTON: Huh?\n - It's that way.\n - It's over here.\n Okay.\n - Wrong room.\n - Wrong room.\n - Aah, aah!\n - Nope, nope.\n Nope, nope.\n Back over here.\n Oh!\n I just came from here.\n - Yeah, we know.\n - That's where she is.\n Go in.\n (Winston whoops)\n Hey, Jess.\n Do you want to have the weirdest wedding of all time?\n To you?\n That's all I want, Miller.\n This is it.\n How do I look?\n Beautif Beautiful.\n (Cece clucks tongue, sighs)\n Thanks for putting this together.\n Of course.\n Oh, thanks for doing this, Padre.\n You know, my day is normally wall-to-wall death, but, uh, you said so many wonderful things about this man, I couldn't help but say yes.\n I thought I was just a monkey with a typewriter.\n Winston's fault.\n That was his fault, 100%.\n (whispering): Thank you.\n Love you, man.\n You two seem like a very happy couple.\n - Thank you.\n - I'm not marrying him.\n I'm marrying a girl.\n - That's okay, too.\n - Music.\n (\"Groovy Kind of Love\" by Phil Collins playing)\n When I'm feeling blue All I have to do Is take a look Can we hurry this along?\n We're three minutes till the next contraction.\n Oh, no, I'm wearing white to a wedding.\n When you're close to me I can feel your heart beat I can hear you breathing Near my ear Wouldn't you agree?\n Baby, you and me Got a groovy Ooh.\n Take care of our pirate bride.\n I'm very proud of you, son.\n I heard you fought like a coward -

I'm patching in \nWinston, Aly and Dan Bill. \nAre we really calling him Dan Bill?  \nIt sounds like a weird town in Connecticut.   \nIt's their child.

That's a nice touch.   \nCECE: Yeah, good vibe, good vibe.   \n- Hella?\n- JESS: It's Jess and Nick. \n- I'm patching in Schmidt, Cece and Ruth.\n- (beeps) \nCece, Schmidt and Ruth, you're on with Jess, Nick,   \nWinston, Aly and Dan Bill.   \n- Hey, Jess, Nick, Dan Bill...\n- Hey, Winston, Dan Bill...   \n- Winston and Aly.\n- Jess and Nick.   \nWho are these people?   \nHey, Schmidt, Cece, Ruth, Jess and Nick.   \nJESS: Guys, I only have the strength \nto say this once.   \nHere I go.   \nOh, God, how do I put this into words? \nOkay, make it quick, 'cause my phone is at four percent,   \nand Ruth has turned my charger into a very sensible belt.   \nSchmidt, just switch your phone to low battery mode.   \nIt really lengthens battery life.   \nHow do you do that? Walk me through it.   \n- Go to Utilities.\n- No, no, Settings. Go to Settings. \nOkay, well, I'm-I'm in Settings.   \n- Guys, please...\n- Oh, shoot.

This is...   \n(sighs) this is life-changing stuff.   \nBrace yourselves.   \nNick and I are...   \nmoving out of the loft.   \n- That's it?\n- Okay.   \nSCHMIDT: That's what you called us here for?   \nWhy do you always think like a character   \n- in The Baby-Sitters Club?\n- (Cece sighs)   \nOkay, okay, you guys process this\nhowever you need to.   \nYou're probably wondering why we would ever move out   \n- in the first place.\n- Yeah, honey, you should've moved out   \nwhen the elevator plunged into the basement   \n- and killed the mailman.\n- We got an eviction notice.   \nThey're kicking us out in    hours.   \nSome evil company called Engram Pattersky Management Group   \nbought the building.   \nYeah, they're kicking us out on our... \"too-tookuses.\"   \nYou trying to say \"tuchases\"?   \n\"Tuchaseses.\"   \n- \"Tuchas\"?\n- \"Tookases.\"   \nLuckily, Nick and I found a very nice two-bedroom   \nwith a lovely reading nook. That doesn't matter.   \nThe point is, we're moving out tomorrow,   \nand I know how much this place means to you guys, so...   \nwhatever you're thinking or feeling,   \nI want you to get it out.   \nSo whoever wants to go first...   \nOkay, I don't think you guys fully heard me.   \n(chuckles) So I'm gonna say it again.   \nNick and I are m...   \n...moving out of the loft.   \nOkay, if you're moving out tomorrow,   \nwhy have you not packed yet?   \nDon't packing-shame us!\nWe're well on our way.   \nWe got four boxes right there.   \nI ran out of tape, so I started using glue.   \nWe'll see how it holds up.   \nCool. Anyway, uh, I'm taking off.   \nHey, let me know when you have the housewarming   \nfor your new place. I'll bring the succulents.   \nYou never brought us succulents. We love succulents.   \nAh, you got me. I don't know what a succulent is.   \nI just said that so I can get the hell out of here. (chuckles)   \nBut I really do got   \nto get going. It's my turn to nurse the baby.   \n- How does he...\n- It's a whole thing.   \nWow, you guys are in so much denial. You're so upset   \nby this news that you're distracting yourself   \nwith nonsense like-like succulents and newborn babies.    \nUh, we left Ruth with our neighbor's stepson, Yonk,    \nso we're gonna go.    \nCECE: Yeah, honey, we're not in denial, okay?    \nWe've just done everything we need to do in this loft.    \nWe're ready to say good-bye.    \nRight. Right. Yeah.    \nYeah, Cece, you're right. You're totally right. You're all...    \ntotally right.    \nOr are you wrong?!    \nNobody leaves until we celebrate this place!    \n(groaning)    \nOkay? So call your sitters, call your babies,    \nget all your affairs in order.    \nI'm gonna go open a bottle of wine. Pink okay?    \nWell, I guess I'll call Yonk and tell him to get cozy.    \n- (groans)\n- Ugh, I can hear Yonk now.    \n(with accent): \"Mr. Schmidt, I got thirsty.    \nI drank all your coconut water.\"    \nFreakin' Yonk.    \nShh, shh, shh, shh, shh.    \nOkay, why are we hiding in your office?    \nBecause, guys, look, I love my wife.    \nYou guys know that I love my wife. But she's clearly going    \nthrough something about us leaving the loft. It's like...    \nit's like she's having a really hard time getting her mouth    \naround the sandwich, do you know what I mean?    \nIf you guys want to get out of here, which I know you do,    \nthen you will laugh when she says laugh,    \nyou will cry when she says cry,    \nand in between, we're gonna pack.    \nI really miss the old days when I would just drop in    \nevery now and then and pick up a suitcase or something.    \nI only have the moving truck for    hours.    \nIf I go one minute over,    \nthose bastards will charge me for a whole nother day.    \nIf you get a whole nother day, might as well get a second week.    \nYou get a second week, you might as well buy the truck,    \n'cause you're livin' in it, Charlie! You live in a mo...    \nThe point I'm trying to make is we need to pack right now.    \nI love packing.    \nYou wouldn't believe how good I am    \nat fitting multiple things into small spaces.    \n- I'm a bento box boy.\n- (chuckling)    \n- What's in that box?\n- What?    \nWhat's the box that says \"gross stuff,\" man?    \nJessica's underpants.    \nSCHMIDT: You have Jess's panties in a box?    \nWell, while I'm delighted    \nthat you have a box...    \nlabeled \"gross stuff\" of your wife's...    \nundergarments, uh,    \nI also feel like you may be lying to me.    \nJESS: Yoo-hoo, guys! Yoo-hoo!    \nYoo-frickin'-hoo!    \nJust remember, if you want to get out of here, play along.    \n     \nBehold!    \nObjects from your past to make you remember and...    \nOh, God, the chair is still spinning. Oh, my God.    \nYou guys, I'm on a dolly.    \nI'm on a greased up dolly, and I'm holding fire.    \nGuys, guys, guys, guys...    \nIf we scatter now, one of us can get out    \nand bring help for the rest.    \nTake in the memories.    \nLet these objects be the milkshake    \nthat bring your memory boys to the emotion yard.    \n- I swore we threw all this stuff away.\n- Wow, I can't believe you    \n- saved all this stuff. How cool is that?\n- But we're really happy it's back.    \n- We're all really happy. Thank you.\n- Yeah.    \nI knew you guys needed to say good-bye.    \n(chuckles) Isn't it amazing how easy it is    \nto do the right thing when you have no other alternative?    \nTotally. (chuckles)    \nLike this.    \nAh, the old loft candy dish.    \n(inhales deeply)    \nThat's the cast from when I broke my penis.    \n(screams) Shut up!    \nYou know, most people wouldn't want to revisit    \nsome of the more painful moments in their lives, but,    \nyou know what, Jess, thank you for this, 'cause I do.    \n- Thank you.\n- Oh, Schmidt, you take that.    \n- (stammers)\n- You're gonna want it.    \nHonestly, it's your penis. You earned it.    \n- Put it in your purse.\n- Excuse me?    \n- Go put it in your purse.\n- I am not putting it in my purse.    \n- Please, Cece, just put it in your purse.\n- I am not gonna go put it...    \n- We'll just leave it here.\n- We'll put it right there.    \nRemember this?    \n- NICK: Oh! Looks just like us!\n- (Cece laughs)    \n- We always pose like that.\n- Can we talk about those skin tones?    \nOh, Nick, this one is so special.    \n- WINSTON: Wow.\n- The wand I used to fix the, uh,    \ngarbage disposal. That one time.    \n(voice breaking):\nDid we find the garbage wand    \nor did the garbage wand find us?    \nI remember the day I found it. I thought,    \n\"Free stick.\"    \n- Ha!\n- Then I brought it home,    \nand it fit into the sink hole.    \n- Mm.\n- And somewhere along    \nthe way, it fixed my heart hole.    \n- It fixed your heart hole?\n- So, thank you, stick.    \n- SCHMIDT: Okay.\n- CECE: I have a tear.    \n- WINSTON: That about sums it up.\n- Yeah.    \nJess, I will never,    \never forget the night that you brought us    \nall together to show us a bunch of our old trash.    \n- CECE: We should let you pack.\n- Okay.    \n- Thank you.\n- Thank you so...    \n- No!\n- Huh?    \nNo one's going anywhere.    \nWe're gonna do all the things in the loft    \nthat we haven't done before.    \n- Like what?\n- (scoffs)    \nI can't believe we've never all stood out    \non the balcony together.    \nYou know who else liked balconies? Hitler.    \nLet's go inside. Let's do more things.    \nI can't believe you've never cleaned the oven, Cece.    \nI think, I think if we just do this,    \nand this, and turn it up real high...    \nI heard that that could work.    \nYeah. What else should we do?    \nWe could all just pack and move Jess and I    \nout of the loft; we've never done that.    \nIt's a joke. It's a joke for sentimentals.    \n- It's a sentimental joke.\n- Oh. I know.    \nTh-This is a big one.    \nYou know, I've never looked around the corner,    \nin the hallway past the bathroom. Like, what's over there?    \nOh my God, what is over there?    \n- What is over there?\n- Yeah.    \n- Whose team are you on?\n- I play for myself.    \nIt's just a wall.    \nMy turn. Cece and I need to use the urinals.    \nFollow me.    \nOh, n-n-no, no, no, no, no.    \nYou just opened Pantera's box.    \nWe do not have time for this right now.    \nWe will get in...    \nPeppermint lotion?    \nIt's for your feet.    \nYay. I love it.    \nI knew it!    \n- Nailed it.\n- Great gift.    \nOh, I'm gonna get you one every year.    \nAnd we're gonna be best friends forever.    \nI just met you, like, a week ago.    \nUh, just 'cause it says \"peppermint,\"    \nnon-edible.    \nI never would have thought to eat this lotion.    \nNicholas, I have been giving you that lotion    \n- every year since we met.\n- I know.    \nI wanted you to experience soft feet for once in your life,    \n- and you... and you lied to me.\n- What did you want me to do?    \nI had just met you when you first gave it to me.    \nThen you actually gave me the lotion again the following year.    \nAnd the lie got on top of me. And now I got all these bottles    \nof lotion and I don't even know how to do this stuff.    \nYou don't know how to \"do\" foot lotion?    \nWhat if I put it on and my feet get...    \nI don't know, too wet and creamy?    \nHas everything been a lie? Has this whole relationship...?    \nDon't call it a relationship, it's a friendship.    \nDon't belittle what we have by calling it a friendship.    \n- No, please.\n- Oh, we don't love each other in Chicago.    \nWe're just friends.    \nPlease, just get over this and help me pack.    \nSure. You've lied to me for years,    \nbut let's just ignore it so I can help you pack    \nwhile humoring your wife    \n- pretending to care.\n- JESS: What?    \nYou guys were humoring me?    \nNick, you told everyone to pretend to care?    \nJess, it's not about that. It's about the truck.    \nI didn't want to go a minute over the    hours,    \nbecause then I, you know, I need to pay for a second day.    \nJess.    \nWait, Jess. I'm sorry.    \nYou guys were just playing along with this?    \nI thought you were just starting to feel something.    \nWait. Am I the one who's in denial about leaving this place?    \nUgh, you sweet, goblin-eyed dum-dum.    \nCECE: Babe, I think the rest of us    \nhave already made peace with this.    \nNo, I get it.    \nI'm not mad. I just...    \nPeople live together in apartments all the time.    \nAnd you guys have lives and kids.    \nAnd this is just a place.    \nBut to me, this is the place where I met all of you.    \n- And that's...\n- (sighs)    \n...that's the best thing that...    \nthat ever happened to me, so...    \nConsider yourselves freed.    \nThe lock never really worked, anyway.    \nPut that down.    \nWe are not going anywhere.    \nYeah, we're gonna say good-bye all day.    \nAll day.    \n- All day!\n- What?    \n- That's not it.\n- You don't say it like that.    \nIt's like, all day. \n- All...\n- All day!    \nGuys, second day    \n- of a moving truck on me.\n- CECE: There we go.    \n- SCHMIDT: That's a big step.\n- Thank you.    \nBut I'm not doing the insurance. I won't do it. I can't do it.    \n- It's a rip-off. It's a freakin' rip-off.\n- Chill, chill, bro.    \n Who's that girl?     \n Who's that girl?     \n It's your favorite bitch, Jess     \n Hang on to your privates 'cause I'm     \n On emotional fy-ahh     \n(imitates guitar)    \nDon't look so surprised, guys.    \n- You knew what this was.\n- (vocalizing)    \nWINSTON: Ah, we had some times here    \n- Mmm.\n- I mean this, right here,    \nright where I'm sitting, is the exact spot    \nthat I realized: I should have less salt in my diet.    \nI should have less salt in my diet.    \nThat's beautiful, man. Stay healthy, baby.    \n- Good memories.\n- Oh, my God.    \nThis is the spot, where, for the weirdest minute of my life,    \nI was super attracted to Winston.    \n- No.\n- We've all been there.    \nIt was my swimmer's body.    \nOoh. Ooh, hey.    \nYeah, they got me on bike duty today.    \nMy hammies need to get into some jammies    \nbecause they are rock-hard.    \n- Yes.\n- (sultry music plays)    \n(echoes): Oh, yeah. That's good stuff.    \nYou feel that? You hear that? Yeah.    \n- Oh!\n- No!    \nOh, it went away pretty quick.    \n(shrieks)    \nI tore my anus.    \nI tore my anus. Oh.    \nI was sitting right here when I first introduced you guys    \nto my hilarious baby voice.    \nUh-oh, look who just woke up.    \n(high-pitched): I'm a baby.    \nI'm a baby    \nand I need my milkie. Where's my Ba-ba?    \n- What are you doing?\n- Put that baby away.    \nBabies can't talk. It's inherently flawed.    \nAnd that's where I met you for the first time.    \n- Aw.\n- I remember you said    \nthat was one of your top five boners of all time.    \nDo you remember you used to rank them?    \n- Be quiet.\n- It's just foot lotion.    \nAnd right over there is where Cece and I    \nhad our first mess around.    \nWhat? Don't tell them.    \nIt's time for the mess around    \nto become the confess around.    \n-  Ain't nobody \n-  Nobody  \n-  Loves me better \n-  Loves me better     \n-  Makes me happy \n- (wood cracks)    \n-  Makes me feel this way \n-  Nobody     \n-  Ain't nobody \n-  Ain't nobody \nWait, wait, wait.    \nIs that a paper plate covered with brown marker to look like floor?    \n- Yeah.\n- That's what that is.    \n- Yeah, yeah. Hmm?\n- Cece?    \nIf you weren't wearing those dumb-ass shoes,    \nand I hadn't just gotten that new dope Chaka Khan CD-ROM...    \n- It was dope as hell.\n- You would not have become my girl.    \n- Babe.\n- Babe. Don't.    \n- Babe.\n- Babe. You better stop.    \n- Babe. Babe.\n- Mmm. Mm-mmm.    \nNo. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna cry.    \nThere' no point. Nobody said nothing about no crying.    \n- That's not what this is.\n- No, no crying.    \n(exhales deeply)    \nWait. Where is Nick?    \nClearly, he doesn't like all of this emotion.    \nHe doesn't have a heart in that butter tub    \nhe calls a body anyway.    \n- He doesn't care about spots.\n- NICK: I'm in here!    \nYou think I don't got spots? I got spots.    \n\"Have.\" Have spots.    \nSorry. Go, keep go...    \nThis spot right here is where my best friend Schmidt and I    \nmoved a couch in.    \nThat happened in the living room, Nick.    \nI know, I just don't want to get up.    \nYou got it? You got it?    \nI got it. I'm good, I'm good, I'm cool.    \n- (grunts)\n- I got it.    \nHouston, we got an \"I got it.\"    \n(grunts)    \n\n\n\nSheesh.    \nSitting pretty close to each other,    \n- don't you think?\n- Oh, sorry.    \nThanks.    \nLot of cool stuff's gonna happen in this loft, huh?    \nYou're telling me, man.    \nWhat do you think's gonna happen here in the next...    \nchunk of our lives?    \nI don't know. I meet a nice lady.    \nShe wants to have a baby with me.    \nWhat does she look like?    \n- Sexy.\n- (laughs)    \nKeep going. Right off the jack.    \nJust, like, you know, like, shows up,    \nbut, like, casually.    \n- You know what I mean? Like...\n- Yeah.    \nwearing a beanie and, like, a little hoodie.    \nYou know what I mean?    \nLike, sort of, like, an orangish-red hoodie.    \n(chuckles)    \nAnyway, man, I just wanted to say, uh...    \nOh.    \n...all thanks.    \nI'm done.    \nWell, it's just lotion. It ain't gonna hurt you, now.    \n(chuckles) Yeah, go ahead. Slap it in there.    \nWow, it's so frickin' creamy.    \nThis is what I've been telling you.    \nIt's really cool.    \n- It actually kind of feels nice.\n- (Jess chuckles)    \nI mean, I got to say, I really like foot lotion.    \nThank you.    \nThey should make more foot lotion for your hand.    \nFoot lotion hand.    \nOr... foot-lotion hand.    \nI don't know.    \nYou should use this for elbows.    \nYou should use lotion for dry parts of your skin.    \n(chuckles)    \nIt's really creamy.    \nFor the first time in my life,    \nI realize my feet could be more than weapons.    \nI love you, man.    \nOh, yeah, that's...    \nWell, yeah, man. I, uh...    \n(whispering): Is he gonna finally say it?    \nGuys, don't-don't put any pressure on him.    \nNo, what? Dude, you're not putting pressure on me.    \n- It's something I want to say.\n- You don't have to say it.    \nI don't need to say anything. I want to say it.    \n- You never said it before.\n- I love you, man.    \n- Yes! (laughs)\n- Are you kidding me right now?    \n- Go, Nick!\n- Are you kidding me?    \n- I love you, man. We're buddies.\n- JESS: Yes!    \nCECE: Really?    \nOh, my feet are so creamy.    \nYou were right. This is what it means    \nto have soft feet, buddy.    \nWell, I feel good.    \nI'm ready to say good-bye to  D.    \nNo, not yet.    \nW-We've done everything.    \nThere's one more thing.    \nJFK!    \nALL: FDR!    \n- FDR!\n- (all cheer)    \n- Wait for me.

Whoa!    \n(Winston whoops)    \nYou go, boy!    \n(whoops)    \nThe middle class is disappearing!    \nBOTH (chanting): Mama, where's my pa?    \nHe's in the White House. Ha, ha, ha!    \nWINSTON: I know a fine brothel right to the left. Yah!    \nWestward ho.    \nWe're coming for your gold.    \nAlmost to Utah, Uncle Brother.    \nI like the look of that ox.    \n- SCHMIDT: Nailed it.\n- Manifest destiny.    \n(all cheering)    \n-  Remember all the drives... \n- Oh, yeah!    \nYou got to drink another root beer.    \n-  To the cloudy mountainsides \n- Chug!

Everyone's getting evicted.    \nThey're turning it into a non-residential space.    \nOh, who did you check with?    \nI hope it was someone important.    \nSorry, Jess. Nothing I can do    \nabout zoning laws. My hands are tied.    \n(whispers): Write the check.    \nOh.

(grunts)    \n(shrieking)    \nOkay, it's done.    \nEverybody in the truck.    \nLet's go.
